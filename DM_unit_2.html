            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><div><br></div><div><strong>Approaches to Disaster Risk Reductions
</strong></div><div>Disaster management meant different for different players. For many decades prior to Major catastrophes like Orissa Super Cyclone (1999), Gujarat Earth quake &amp; West Bengal Floods (2000) disaster management for respective state governments was to emphasis on early warning, evacuation, post disaster compensation, rehabilitation, shelter construction, i.e., basically reactive.
</div><div><br></div><div>And, NGOs, who consider they to be grounded and realistic typically considered disaster management as distributing cash, clothes, providing medical assistance, water purification, etc. Most important, they tended relax until the next disaster! They didn’t do much between two disasters to reduce the impact, reduce the vulnerability and susceptibility of the people.
</div><div><br></div><div>The perspective however has changed with a series of disasters mentioned above. Oxfam’s community based disaster preparedness (CBDP) approach has been replicated by different NGOs in different states with suitable adaptation to the local context. However, most of these initiatives are being implemented in isolation and as a project with limited life cycle, instead of integrating disaster preparedness in ongoing development programs.
</div><div><br></div><div>DRR (disaster risk reduction) is a part of sustainable development, so it must involve every part of society, government, non-governmental organizations and the professional and private sector. It therefore requires a people-centred and multi-sector approach, building resilience to multiple, cascading and interacting hazards and creating a culture of prevention and resilience. Consequently DRM includes strategies designed to:
</div><div><br></div><div>•	avoid the construction of new risks
</div><div>•	address pre-existing risks
</div><div>•	share and spread risk to prevent disaster losses being absorbed by other development outcomes and creating additional poverty
</div><div><br></div><div>Successful DRR results from the combination of top-down, institutional changes and strategies, with bottom-up, local and community-based approaches. DRM programmes should not be standalone but instead be integrated within development planning and practice, since disasters are an indicator of failed or skewed development, of unsustainable economic and social processes, and of ill-adapted societies.
</div><div><br></div><div>Approaches need to address the different layers of risk (from intensive to extensive risk), underlying risk drivers, as well as be tailored to local contexts. There is no ‘one-size fits all’ approach to DRM(disaster risk management), but there exist a number of approaches and frameworks, which have been effectively implemented to reduce disaster risk. But, before being able to reduce risk, we need to understand the hazards, and the exposure and vulnerability of people and assets to those hazards.

</div><div><strong>Disaster risk management steps
</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Prevention 
</strong></div><div>Activities and measures to avoid existing and new disaster risks (often less costly than disaster relief and response). For instance, relocating exposed people and assets away from a hazard area.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mitigation 
</strong></div><div>The lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters. For instance, constructing flood defences, planting trees to stabilize slopes and implementing strict land use and building construction codes.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Transfer 
</strong></div><div>The process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequences of particular risks from one party to another whereby a household, community, enterprise or state authority will obtain resources from the other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing or compensatory social or financial benefits provided to that other party. For instance, insurance.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Preparedness 
</strong></div><div>The knowledge and capacities of governments, professional response and recovery organisations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions. For instance, installing early warning systems, identifying evacuation routes and preparing emergency supplies.
</div><div><br></div><div>Activities for reducing risk can be described as structural, for instance land use planning and implementation of building codes, and non-structural, for instance awareness raising, policy-making and legislation. How governments, civil society and other actors organise DRM, for example through institutional arrangements, legislation and decentralisation, and mechanisms for participation and accountability is termed risk governance. There is clear evidence to suggest that low-income countries with weak governance are more vulnerable and less resilient to disaster risk.
</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, DRR succeeds in reducing risk by building the strengths, attributes and resources available within a community, society or organization – collectively known as their capacity. DRM activities are designed to increase the resilience of people, communities, society and systems to resist, absorb, accommodate and to recover from and improve well-being in the face of multiple hazards. Activities for reducing and managing risks can therefore provide a way for building resilience to other risks. In addition to development, DRM should therefore be integrated across a number of sectors, including climate change and conflict.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Identifying and understanding risk: the foundation of risk reduction 
</strong></div><div>Awareness, identification, understanding and measurement of disaster risks are all clearly fundamental underpinnings of disaster risk management . Disaster risk reduction is about decisions and choices, including a lack of, so risk information has a role in five key areas of decision making:
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Risk identification 
</strong></div><div>Because the damages and losses caused by historical disasters are often not widely known, and because the potential damages and losses that could arise from future disasters (including infrequent but high-impact events) may not be known at all, DRM is given a low priority. Appropriate communication of robust risk information at the right time can raise awareness and trigger action.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Risk reduction 
</strong></div><div>Hazard and risk information may be used to inform a broad range of activities to reduce risk, from improving building codes and designing risk reduction measures (such as flood and storm surge protection), to carrying out macro-level assessments of the risks to different types of buildings (for prioritizing investment in reconstruction and retrofitting, for example).
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Preparedness 
</strong></div><div>An understanding of the geographic area affected, along with the intensity and frequency of different hazard events, is critical for planning evacuation routes, creating shelters, and running preparedness drills. Providing a measure of the impact of different hazard events—potential number of damaged buildings, fatalities and injuries, secondary hazards—makes it possible to establish detailed and realistic plans for better response to disasters, which can ultimately reduce the severity of adverse natural events.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Financial protection 
</strong></div><div>Disaster risk analysis was born out of the financial and insurance sector’s need to quantify the risk of comparatively rare high-impact natural hazard events. As governments increasingly seek to manage their sovereign financial risk or support programs that manage individual financial risks (e.g., micro-insurance or household earthquake insurance).
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Resilient reconstruction 
</strong></div><div>Risk assessment can play a critical role in impact modelling before an event strikes (in the days leading up to a cyclone, for example), or it can provide initial and rapid estimates of human, physical, and economic loss in an event’s immediate aftermath. Moreover, risk information for resilient reconstruction needs to be available before an event occurs, since after the event there is rarely time to collect the information needed to inform resilient design and land-use plans.

</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Disaster Cycle
</strong></div><div>Disaster management aims to reduce, or avoid, the potential losses from hazards, assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims of disaster, and achieve rapid and effective recovery. 
</div><div><br></div><div>The Disaster management cycle illustrates the ongoing process by which governments, businesses, and civil society plan for and reduce the impact of disasters, react during and immediately following a disaster, and take steps to recover after a disaster has occurred. Appropriate actions at all points in the cycle lead to greater preparedness, better warnings, reduced vulnerability or the prevention of disasters during the next iteration of the cycle. The complete disaster management cycle includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either modify the causes of disasters or mitigate their effects on people, property, and infrastructure.
</div><div><br></div><div>The mitigation and preparedness phases occur as disaster management improvements are made in anticipation of a disaster event. Developmental considerations play a key role in contributing to the mitigation and preparation of a community to effectively confront a disaster. As a disaster occurs, disaster management actors, in particular humanitarian organizations, become involved in the immediate response and long-term recovery phases. The four disaster management phases illustrated here do not always, or even generally, occur in isolation or in this precise order. Often phases of the cycle overlap and the length of each phase greatly depends on the severity of the disaster.
</div><div><br></div><div>o	Mitigation - Minimizing the effects of disaster.
</div><div>Examples: building codes and zoning; vulnerability analyses; public education.
</div><div><br></div><div>o	Preparedness - Planning how to respond.
</div><div>Examples: preparedness plans; emergency exercises/training; warning systems.
</div><div><br></div><div>o	Response - Efforts to minimize the hazards created by a disaster.
</div><div>Examples: search and rescue; emergency relief .</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>o	Recovery - Returning the community to normal.
</div><div>Examples: temporary housing; grants; medical care. 
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sustainable Development
</strong></div><div>Developmental considerations contribute to all aspects of the disaster management cycle. One of the main goals of disaster management, and one of its strongest links with development, is the promotion of sustainable livelihoods and their protection and recovery during disasters and emergencies. Where this goal is achieved, people have a greater capacity to deal with disasters and their recovery is more rapid and long lasting. In a development oriented disaster management approach, the objectives are to reduce hazards, prevent disasters, and prepare for emergencies. Therefore, developmental considerations are strongly represented in the mitigation and preparedness phases of the disaster management cycle. Inappropriate development processes can lead to increased vulnerability to disasters and loss of preparedness for emergency situations.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mitigation
</strong></div><div>Mitigation activities actually eliminate or reduce the probability of disaster occurrence, or reduce the effects of unavoidable disasters. Mitigation measures include building codes; vulnerability analyses updates; zoning and land use management; building use regulations and safety codes; preventive health care; and public education. 
</div><div>Mitigation will depend on the incorporation of appropriate measures in national and regional development planning. Its effectiveness will also depend on the availability of information on hazards, emergency risks, and the countermeasures to be taken. The mitigation phase, and indeed the whole disaster management cycle, includes the shaping of public policies and plans that either modify the causes of disasters or mitigate their effects on people, property, and infrastructure.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Preparedness
</strong></div><div>The goal of emergency preparedness programs is to achieve a satisfactory level of readiness to respond to any emergency situation through programs that strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of governments, organizations, and communities. These measures can be described as logistical readiness to deal with disasters and can be enhanced by having response mechanisms and procedures, rehearsals, developing long-term and short-term strategies, public education and building early warning systems. Preparedness can also take the form of ensuring that strategic reserves of food, equipment, water, medicines and other essentials are maintained in cases of national or local catastrophes.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>During the preparedness phase, governments, organizations, and individuals develop plans to save lives, minimize disaster damage, and enhance disaster response operations. Preparedness measures include preparedness plans; emergency exercises/training; warning systems; emergency communications systems; evacuations plans and training; resource inventories; emergency personnel/contact lists; mutual aid agreements; and public information/education. As with mitigations efforts, preparedness actions depend on the incorporation of appropriate measures in national and regional development plans. In addition, their effectiveness depends on the availability of information on hazards, emergency risks and the countermeasures to be taken, and on the degree to which government agencies, non-governmental organizations and the general public are able to make use of this information.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Humanitarian Action
</strong></div><div>During a disaster, humanitarian agencies are often called upon to deal with immediate response and recovery. To be able to respond effectively, these agencies must have experienced leaders, trained personnel, adequate transport and logistic support, appropriate communications, and guidelines for working in emergencies. If the necessary preparations have not been made, the humanitarian agencies will not be able to meet the immediate needs of the people. 
</div><div>Response
</div><div>The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food, to establishing semi-permanent settlement in camps and other locations. It also may involve initial repairs to damaged infrastructure. The focus in the response phase is on meeting the basic needs of the people until more permanent and sustainable solutions can be found. Humanitarian organizations are often strongly present in this phase of the disaster management cycle.
</div><div><strong>Recovery
</strong></div><div>As the emergency is brought under control, the affected population is capable of undertaking a growing number of activities aimed at restoring their lives and the infrastructure that supports them. There is no distinct point at which immediate relief changes into recovery and then into long-term sustainable development. There will be many opportunities during the recovery period to enhance prevention and increase preparedness, thus reducing vulnerability. Ideally, there should be a smooth transition from recovery to on-going development.
</div><div>Recovery activities continue until all systems return to normal or better. Recovery measures, both short and long term, include returning vital life-support systems to minimum operating standards; temporary housing; public information; health and safety education; reconstruction; counseling programs; and economic impact studies. Information resources and services include data collection related to rebuilding, and documentation of lessons learned. 
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Structural and non-structural measures
</strong></div><div>Structural measures are any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, or the application of engineering techniques or technology to achieve hazard resistance and resilience in structures or systems. 
</div><div><br></div><div>Non-structural measures are measures not involving physical construction which use knowledge, practice or agreement to reduce disaster risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training and education.
</div><div>Annotation: Common structural measures for disaster risk reduction include dams, flood levies, ocean wave barriers, earthquake-resistant construction and evacuation shelters. Common non-structural measures include building codes, land-use planning laws and their enforcement, research and assessment, information resources and public awareness programmes. Note that in civil and structural engineering, the term “structural” is used in a more restricted sense to mean just the load-bearing structure, and other parts such as wall cladding and interior fittings are termed “non-structural”.

</div><div><strong>PRI:</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>•	Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) is a system of rural local self-government in India.
</div><div>•	Local Self Government is the management of local affairs by such local bodies who have been elected by the local people.
</div><div>•	PRI was constitutionalized through the 73rdConstitutional Amendment Act, 1992 to build democracy at the grass roots level and was entrusted with the task of rural development in the country.
</div><div>•	In its present form and structure PRI has completed 26 years of existence. However, a lot remains to be done in order to further decentralization and strengthen democracy at the grass root level.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Evaluating the Panchayati Raj Institutions at 26
</strong></div><div>•	PRIs has witnessed simultaneously a remarkable success and a staggering failure in the journey of 26 years depending on the goalposts against which they are evaluated.
</div><div>•	While the PRI has succeeded in creating another layer of government and political representation at the grass-roots level, it has failed to provide better governance.
</div><div>•	There are about 250,000 PRIs and urban local bodies, and over three million elected local government representatives.
</div><div>•	The 73rd and 74th Amendments required that no less than one-third of the total seats in local bodies should be reserved for women. At 1.4 million, India has the most women in elected positions. Seats and sarpanch/pradhan positions were also reserved for SC/ST candidates.
</div><div>•	Research using PRIs has shown that having female political representation in local governments makes women more likely to come forward and report crimes.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">In districts with female sarpanchs, significantly greater investments are made in drinking water, public goods.</span></div><div>•	Moreover, the states have also provided the statutory safeguards for many devolution provisions, which have considerably empowered local governments.
</div><div>•	Successive (central) Finance Commissions have, so substantially, increased fund allocations for local bodies and also the grants have been increased.
</div><div>•	15th Finance Commission is also considering to further increase the allocations for local governments to match the international standards.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>UBL
</strong></div><div>Urban Local government implies the governance of an urban area by the people through their elected representatives. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 provided constitutional status to local urban bodies.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Functions of Urban Local Bodies
</strong></div><div>It is a common practice to divide the organisation of a corporation or a municipality into two parts:
</div><div>(a) deliberative and (b) executive part
</div><div><br></div><div>The corporation, council or municipal board or council consisting of the elected representatives of the people constitutes the deliberative part. It acts like a legislature.
</div><div>It discusses and debates on general municipal policies and performance, passes the budget of the urban local body, frames broad policies relating to taxation, resources raising, pricing of services and other aspects of municipal administration.
</div><div><br></div><div>It keeps an eye on municipal administration and holds the executive accountable for what is done or not done. For instance, if water supply is not being properly managed, or there is an outbreak of an epidemic, the deliberative wing criticises the role of the administration and suggests measures for improvement.
</div><div>The executive part of municipal administration is looked after by the municipal officers and other permanent employees. In the corporations, the Municipal Commissioner is the executive head, and all other departmental officers like engineers, finance officers, health officers etc. function under his/her control and supervision.
</div><div><br></div><div>In a large corporation, such as Delhi or Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the Commissioner is usually a senior IAS officer. In municipalities, the executive officer holds a similar position and looks after the overall administration of a municipality.
</div><div><br></div><div>Municipal functions are generally classified into </div><div>obligatory and discretionary types.
</div><div><br></div><div>The obligatory (compulsory) functions are those that the municipal body must perform. In this category fall such functions as water supply; construction and maintenance of roads, streets, bridges, subways and other public works, street lighting; drainage and sewerage; garbage collection and disposal; prevention and control of epidemics.
</div><div><br></div><div>Some other obligatory functions are public vaccination and inoculation; maintenance of hospitals and dispensaries including maternity and child welfare centres; checking food adulteration; removal of slums; supply of electricity; maintenance of cremation and burial grounds; and town planning. In some States some of these functions may be taken over by State Government.
</div><div><br></div><div>The discretionary functions are those that a municipal body may take up if funds permit. These are given less priority. Some of the discretionary functions are construction and maintenance of rescue homes and orphanages, housing for low income groups, organising public receptions, provision of treatment facilities, etc.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Type of urban governments
</strong></div><div>There are eight types of urban governments in India.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1.	Municipal Corporation: </strong>Municipal corporations are created for the administration of big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and others. A Municipal Corporation has three authorities namely, the council (legislative wing of the corporation), the standing committee (to facilitate the working of the council) and the commissioner (chief executive authority of the corporation).The council consist of councillors directly elected by people and is headed by a Mayor while the Commissioner is appointed by state government and is generally an IAS officer.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2.	Municipality: </strong>The municipalities are established for the administration of towns and smaller cities. They are known by various other names like municipal council, municipal committee, municipal board, borough municipality, city municipality and others. In composition they are quite similar to municipal corporations except that head of council is called President /chairman and in place of commissioner they have a chief executive officer/chief municipal officer.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3.	Notified Area Committee: </strong>A notified area committee is created for the administration of two types of areas- a fast developing town due to industrialisation, and a town which does not yet fulfill all the conditions necessary for the constitution of a municipality, but which otherwise is considered important by the state government. It is called so because it is created by a notification and unlike the municipality it is an entirely nominated body, i.e. all members, including the Chairman, are nominated by the state government. Thus, it is neither a statutory body (created by law) nor an elected body.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.	Town Area Committee:</strong> It is set up by a separate act of state legislature for the administration of a small town. It is a semi-municipal authority entrusted with limited number of civic functions. It may be wholly elected or wholly nominated or partly elected and partly nominated as provided by state government.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5.	Cantonment Board:</strong> It is established for municipal administration for civilian population in the cantonment areas (area where military forces and troops are permanently stationed). It is set up under the provisions of the Cantonment Act, 2006 by central government and works under Defence ministry of central government. It is partly elected and partly nominated body having the Military officer commanding the station as its ex-officio President. Vice president is elected amongst by the elected members of board. The executive officer of the cantonment board is appointed by the President of India.,
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6.	Township:</strong> It is established by large public enterprises to provide civic amenities to its staff and workers, who live in the housing colonies built near the plant. It is not an elected body and all members, including the town administrator, is appointed by the enterprise itself.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7.	Port Trust: </strong>The port trusts are established in the port areas like Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and so on for two purposes: (a) to manage and protect the ports; (b) to provide civic amenities. It is created by an Act of Parliament and it consists of both elected and nominated members.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8.	Special Purpose Agency: </strong>The states have set up certain agencies to undertake designated activities or specific functions that legitimately belong to the domain of municipal corporations, municipalities or other local urban governments. In other words, these are function based, not area based. They are known as ‘single purpose’, ‘uni-purpose’ or ‘special purpose’ or ‘functional local bodies’ like town improvement trust, housing boards, pollution control boars etc. They are established as statutory bodies by an act of state legislature or as departments by an executive resolution. They function as an autonomous body and are not subordinate agencies to local municipal bodies.

</strong></div><div>Context: Recently, NDRF conducted rescue operations after an Air India Express flight crash-landed in Kerala’s Kozhikode.
</div><div><br></div><div>Origin of NDRF
</div><div>•	National Disaster Management Act, 2005
</div><div>Disaster Management Act in 2005 was passed as a much-needed step towards determining responsibility and accountability for disaster response. 
</div><div>These issues were highlighted by major calamities like the 2001 earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Provisions in the DM act,2005 :
</strong></div><div>•	The law laid down a legal framework for disaster response at the national, state, and district levels.
</div><div>•	The Act paved the way for establishing Disaster Management Authorities at the national, state, and district levels .
</div><div>•	It also provided for setting up the National Disaster Response and Mitigation Funds, and the formation of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).
</div><div>•	The National Disaster Management Authority is chaired by the Prime Minister.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>The constitution of NDRF and its structure
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>•	Personnel:
</strong></div><div>o	The NDRF was raised in 2006, initially with eight battalions, and now has 12 spread across the country. 
</div><div>o	Each battalion, which has a sanctioned strength of 1,150 rescuers, caters to particular states as their areas of responsibility. 
</div><div>o	In case required, teams from other battalions are also moved for emergency response.
</div><div>o	The NDRF gets personnel and officers on deputation from the Central Armed Police Force(CAPF) for a period of seven years. After serving their tenure, personnel go back to their force.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>•	Training
</strong></div><div>o	After personnel and officers are deputed to the NDRF, they undergo a first responder course for five months. 
</div><div>o	Later on, sections of personnel get advanced specialized training in 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Deep diving, 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Special search and rescue, 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Collapsed structure search and rescue, 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear emergencies, and also 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Psycho-social intervention. 
</div><div>o	Some of the personnel further undergo specialized training with national and international institutions including those on chemical and biological warfare situations.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>•	Structure:
</strong></div><div>o	Battalions are divided into rescue teams which are self-contained emergency response units.
</div><div>o	These units contain specialist search and rescue groups, engineering, technical, electrical experts along with dog squads, and paramedics. 
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>•	Regulation:
</strong></div><div>o	NDRF functions under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and is headed by a Director-General.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Diverse role of NDRF
</strong></div><div>•	The strategies of preemptive availability and pre-positioning of teams anticipating emergency situations, facilitated by the nationwide presence of its battalions, has made sure that damages are contained. 
</div><div>•	The NDRF is equipped and trained to handle a range of difficulties, from borewell accidents to chemical, biological and radioactive emergencies.
</div><div>•	NDRF has conducted relief, rescue, evacuation operations during all the major natural or man-made disasters in the country,including floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, structure collapses, and even some cases of retrieval or radiological materials. 
</div><div>•	NDRF teams have also responded to road and train accidents, and also boat capsizes.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Way ahead
</strong></div><div>•	Upgrading technology:
</div><div>o	While the NDRF has been able to keep upgrading its technology, still more needs to be done. 
</div><div>o	For example, the agency acquired Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the past, but officials say an all weather UAV which can even function in extreme conditions is the need of the hour. 
</div><div>o	The NDRF also requires upgraded versions of life detection systems, which will further enhance capabilities during structure collapse responses.
</div><div>•	While the NDRF will remain the main national agency, there is an urgent need to build efficient State Disaster Response Forces (SDRFs) across states.
