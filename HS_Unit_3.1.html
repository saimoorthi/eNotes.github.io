A cleaning schedule for all areas and departments should be planned to maintain clean surroundings. &nbsp;
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>CLEANING AND SANITISING
</strong></div><div>Before we discuss the procedures it is important to understand the difference between cleaning and sanitising.
</div><div>
</div><div>•	Cleaning is the removal of matter from a surface on which it is not acceptable. For effective cleaning, soiled surface should be in contact with a cleaning agent for adequate time and sufficient pressure should be applied if required, to remove the soil. Cleaning involves two steps: a wash step and a rinse step.
</div><div>
</div><div>•	Sanitising is a reduction in the number of diseases causing bacteria to safe levels. This is achieved through the use of heat or the application of chemical compounds. It involves one step only, a sanitise step.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>NECESSITY FOR AN EFFICIENT CLEANING PROGRAMME
</strong></div><div>Both cleaning and sanitising form the basis of food service sanitation.
</div><div>The main purpose of cleaning and sanitising dishes is to remove visible surface dirt and reduce the number of bacteria to a safe level so as to
</div><div>•	reduce health hazards by avoiding contamination
</div><div>•	prevent spoilage of food
</div><div>•	control odour
</div><div>•	create a pleasing appearance
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Before any cleaning programme is implemented, it is necessary that all food service workers understand the importance of cleaning procedures. It is the duty of every employee to ascertain that all dishes and utensils used in the catering establishment are clean. Dishes are handled by various people like waiters, cooks and dishwashers. Dishes cleaned and sanitised by dishwashers may be mishandled and contaminated after washing. They may collect dust or get covered with a greasy film if they are not stored or handled properly.
</div><div>An act of carelessness on part of one person, can cancel the painstaking efforts of others and result in wastage of costly detergents, money invested in machines, labour, etc.
</div><div>It is important to note that no matter how well food is prepared and served, it is unacceptable if served in improperly cleaned dishes or accompanied by unclean crockery or cutlery, which retains the smell or remanent of the food served in it earlier.
</div><div>Cleaning removes visible soil, sanitising reduces microbial load to a safe level.
</div><div>All utensils, equipment, tableware and other food contact surfaces used in the food service operation must be cleaned and sanitised after every major use or at least once a day. Any utensil or equipment used in the storage, preparation and service of food and which touches the food directly, is a food contact surface. Pots, pans, dishes, glasses, cutlery, trays, mixer bowls, slicing machines, chopping boards, work platforms and stainless steel table tops are food contact surfaces which do not touch the food directly are non-food contact surfaces like the top of the refrigerator, the bottom of work platforms and tables, floors, etc. These surfaces need to be cleaned regularly and sanitised occasionally.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Cleaning Agents
</strong></div><div>Water alone is not sufficient to remove dirt, grease or stains from food contact surfaces. For effective cleaning certain cleaning agents should be used. Cleaning agents include all materials that are required to effectively clean surfaces, dishes, utensils, equipment and machines in the kitchen. They include soaps, detergents and other chemical substances such as sanitisers and disinfectants. Cleaning tools like scrubbers, steel wool, brushes, etc., aid in the action of the cleaning agent.

</div><div><strong>Dishwashing
</strong></div><div>Dishes are washed in sinks or in the dishwashing machine. Dishwashing is one of the most important tasks in any food service establishment. Unfortunately, it is one of the most neglected areas. The job is usually assigned to the lowest grade of employees who are inexperienced, unskilled and do not understand the importance of using the right amount of detergent, water or time for this work. It is the responsibility of the management to select correct methods of dishwashing and train employees accordingly.
</div><div>Whether clearing dishes or cleaning premises, there has been a gradual perceptible shift from manual cleaning to mechanised cleaning machines. Dishwashing machines have the following advantages and disadvantages.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Advantages
</strong></div><div>1.	They can clean faster.
</div><div>2.	Lessen day to day financial expenditure.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Disadvantages 
</strong></div><div>1.	Initial investment is high.
</div><div>2.	Trained personnel are required.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Both manual as well as machine cleaning have their own advantages and disadvantages and a wise facilities manager will weigh the pros and cons of both before taking a decision.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><div><strong>THREE METHODS TO WASH, RINSE AND SANITISE FOOD CONTACT SURFACES
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>There are three methods to wash, rinse and sanitise food contact surfaces— the three bucket method, the sink method and the dishwashing machine method. The method to be used will depend on many factors, such as the surface to be cleaned and the size and nature of the food service establishment.
</div><div>Even if all dishes are machine washed, workers should be trained in manual methods as well. All methods listed above follow three basic steps, namely, wash, rinse and sanitise. All these steps are necessary for proper cleaning and sanitising.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The Three Bucket Method
</strong></div><div>This method is used to clean and sanitise equipment which is too large to place in a sink or dishwashing machine or is stationary. Three separate buckets, containing a wash, rinse and a sanitising solution, are required. All buckets should have different colours.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Procedure for the Three Bucket Method
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>1.	Wash :</strong> Remove food scraps from the surface to be cleaned. In the first bucket, mix detergent in warm water. Scrub surface with a scourer to loosen food, grease and dirt.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>2.	Rinse: </strong>Take clean warm water in the second bucket. Wipe the  surface with a sponge to remove loosened soil and detergent till surface is clean. If surface does not look and feel clean, repeat these two steps.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>3.	Sanitise:</strong> Add chlorine in the correct concentration to warm water in the third bucket. With a clean sponge, wipe the entire surface lightly and allow solution to air dry. Do not dry surface with a dishcloth. Large equipment is sanitised by rinsing carefully with boiling water, or live steam from a hose in case of equipment in which steam can be confined.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Sink Method
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Dishes, pots, pans, chopping boards, containers, knives, spoons and other small utensils are washed and sanitised in sinks. Sinks should ideally have three compartments so that washing, rinsing and sanitising can be done in separate sinks. A one or two compartment sink is not very hygienic as all steps are carried out in the same sink.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Equipment required
</strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Sinks: </strong>Three compartments with a hot and cold water supply are required. The sinks should be large enough to hold washing baskets and allow dishes to immerse completely in wash solution. They should be made of a non-toxic, non-corrosive, smooth material  like stainless steel or vitreous enamel. Galvanised iron sinks are recommended for washing large pots and pans. The sink should have an overflow pipe to remove excess water. The pipe should be fitted with a strainer and funnel to remove food residue and prevent clogging. </div><div>There should be a slope near the drain for self-draining. The number of sinks required depends on the number and variety of meals served. Separate sinks should be used for crockery and cutlery and for pan washing.
</div><div>Waste pipe traps should be removable, smooth, easy to clean and easily fitted. Plastic, which is acid and hot water resistant, is preferred. A spray hose fitted to the sink is a desirable feature to wash down the sink and the draining boards.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Drains: </strong>They should be 10 to 15 cms (four to six inches) in diameter to remove all waste water without the risk of flooding. Grease traps should be cleaned regularly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Ware tables and drain boards: </strong>They are necessary to hold soiled dishes before washing and to hold clean dishes after washing. They should be large enough, self-draining and should be so placed that they do not interfere with washing procedures.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Ware washing baskets: </strong>They are used for immersing soiled ware in the rinse and sanitising compartments. They should have long handles and be large enough to handle the normal load of wares. They should ensure complete immersion of items and prevent contamination of cleaned and sanitised items by human hands.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Booster heaters: </strong>They should supply hot water between 74 to 82c for sanitisation. They should ideally be located under the final rinse sink to prevent water temperature from dropping.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Thermometers:</strong> They are meant for dishwashing and should be portable and accurate to within 20C.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Clock:</strong> It is necessary to check immersion time during sanitisation and the clock should have a seconds hand.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8.Cleaning tools: </strong>Bristle brushes, scourers and abrasive pads in a good state of repair should be placed in a convenient place. Sponges should be avoided as they encourage the growth of microorganisms.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Procedures for three Sink method</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong> 
</strong></div><div>Check that sink is properly clean before starting work.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Scrape and pre-rinse:</strong> This is to remove loose soil from dishes and keep wash water cleaner and free from bacterial build-up. A scraper or squeegee is used and food residue is transferred to a garbage container. Sometimes, soaking may be necessary to remove more stubborn residues.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Washing: </strong>The first sink contains a hot detergent solution at 43.5 C to 52C. Dishes are washed in this sink with the help of cleaning tools. All visible soil is removed from the surface of dishes. As more and more articles are washed, the effectiveness of the detergent is reduced. The detergent solution is no longer effective when a scum or grease layer forms on water and should be changed. Brushes and scourers should be cleaned, sanitised and dried' Grease is removed at 52 C.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Rinsing: </strong>The second sink contains water at till washing solution other materials is removed and dishes are clean and touch. Rinse water should be changed when it becomes dirty. If a basket is used, dip entire basket all traces of detergent are removed. A basket must be used sanitise dishes because (a) it reduces hand contact with eating surfaces of and (b) temperature of water needed for sanitation is too high for the use of hands.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.Sanitising:</strong> This step removes any soil and microorganism that remain after rinsing and has a bacteriostatic Sanitisers used may be chemicals or water at specific temperature and pressure. The concentration and duration of immersion should be strictly followed.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5.Drying:</strong> No item should be touched on the food or mouth contact surface. All items should be air dried to retain effects of sanitation. They can be left in the baskets to dry. Glasses should be inverted on a well ventilated drain board. Towel or dish cloth drying is not recommended.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mechanical Dishwashing
</strong></div><div>A dishwashing machine is used to clean and sanitise all plates, glasses, cups, saucers, knives, forks and spoons which are used in the dining area. Other equipment and utensils that fit in the machine can also be cleaned and sanitised. 
</div><div>The machines work automatically and are extremely useful where quantity food preparation and service takes place, as both time and labour are saved. For effective cleaning, it is necessary to follow the manufacturer's operating instructions carefully and to maintain the equipment in good working condition.
</div><div><br></div><div>Before selecting a machine it is essential to have the following details
</div><div>•	type of ware
</div><div>•	volume of dishes to be washed
</div><div>•	type of food service establishment
</div><div>•	space available for dishwashing
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Types Of dishwashing machines</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Dishwashing machines are basically of two types: 
</div><div>•	stationary machines  
</div><div>•	conveyor machines.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Stationary machines: </strong>These machines have a single tank. The articles to be washed are suitably placed in the rack and the racks are lifted and placed in the machine. The rack Of dishes stays in one place while the wash and rinse solution circulates around the dishes. The timing is automatically controlled in most machines.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Conveyor machines:</strong> In the conveyor machine, the dishes move on a conveyor belt through the different cycles of washing, rinsing and sanitising. The dishes are either placed in racks on the conveyor belt or directly on the pegged conveyor belt.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Conveyor machines may have
</strong></div><div>• a single tank where dishes are cleaned by the wash solution at one end and conveyed to the clean end of the machine where it activates fresh water at 82C (180F). Water is sprayed from nozzles above and below the dishes.
</div><div>
</div><div>•&nbsp; two tanks or multiple tanks: the first tank, i.e. the wash tank, contains the detergent solution. After the wash cycle, the rack is conveyed through the power rinse tank to rinse the dishes free of most of the detergent solution. The rack then passes through the final rinse for sanitisation. The racks are transported through the machine on a pre timed conveyor at a speed set by the manufacturer. These machines are recommended for larger establishments.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Loading of dishes may be done from the top or side of the machine, depending on the model. Dishes are cleaned in a machine either by a jet or spray of hot water and detergent, forcefully sprayed to remove soil; by revolving brushes that scrub soil off the dishes; or by mechanically agitating the detergent solution to help in removing soil.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Steps in dishwashing Before beginning the cleaning operation, it is essential that the machine, dish tables and work area is clean. Some preliminary steps which should be checked are:</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>•&nbsp; Check the insides of the machine to ensure that no food soil, broken dishes or other foreign objects are present.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Overflow pipes should be free of debris.
</div><div>• Spray arms should be clean and properly installed.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Inspect final rinse nozzles and see that they are not blocked.
</div><div>• Make sure sufficient detergent is present in the dispensers.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Keep scrap bins and strainers in place.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Operating procedure 
</strong></div><div>The following steps should be adhered to for successful cleaning:
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1.	Sorting:</strong> Set aside any dishes that require special handling, as well as heavily stained dishes which will not get cleaned by the routine cleaning process in the machine.
</div><div><strong>2.	Preliminary scraping and pre-rinsing:</strong> Remove excessive loose food particles with the help of a rubber scraper. The purpose of scraping is
</div><div>•&nbsp; to prevent the clogging of spray nozzles with food particles
</div><div>• to avoid frequent changes of wash water
</div><div>•&nbsp; to reduce bacterial contamination of wash water
</div><div>•&nbsp; &nbsp;to remove as much grease as possible prior to washing
</div><div>•&nbsp; to wet the soil remaining on the dishes
</div><div>•&nbsp; to facilitate easy cleaning
</div><div>
</div><div>Manual pre-rinsing is not required if the machine has a power pre-rinse attached.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3.	Soaking: </strong>This may be necessary for dishes on which soil has hardened or dried, especially flatware may need soaking for some time to loosen the soil. Soaking can be done in tubs placed under the counters or ware tables.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4.	Racking:</strong> In this step, the dishes are arranged either in racks for conveyance through the machine or on a pegged conveyor for travel through it. It involves proper placement of dishes to permit the wash and rinse solution to come in contact with all surfaces to be cleaned.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Cleaning is most effective and breakages are reduced to a minimum when
</div><div>a)	there is no overcrowding of dishes
</div><div>b)	similar sized objects are racked together
</div><div>c)	cups and glasses and other deep dishes are placed open end down to prevent water accumulation
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5.	Washing:</strong> The purpose of washing is to remove all food soil from the dishes and dissolve the grease on dishware. This requires clean water, with correct proportion of detergent at the right temperature and pressure, in contact with the dishes for the proper amount of time. The detergent solution circulates at a specific rate as the dishes pass through this tank. The temperature of the washing solution will vary according to the type of the machine and its specifications.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>6.	Power rinse:</strong> It completely removes most of the detergent-laden water and permits effective sanitisation. Because of the build-up of heat, it hastens the drying process. Hot pumped rinse water is sprayed over the dishes in the correct volume and with sufficient pressure to rinse
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>7.	Final rinse and sanitisation: </strong>At this stage, any remaining detergent is removed and the dishes are sanitised. If water is used as a sanitiser, then it should be sprayed in adequate volumes and at a correct pressure with temperatures varying between 77 and 82C. Ideally, as it leaves the nozzles it should have a temperature of 82C. However, it should not exceed 90 to 930C, as the water at that temperature under pressure would atomise and become vapour. 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>The hotter the water used for sanitising, the faster the drying and lesser chances of water spotting. A drying agent may be injected in this cycle.
</div><div>
</div><div>If chemical sanitisers are used, dishes should be immersed for at least one minute at concentrations mentioned in below image
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>8.	Drying: </strong>Crockery and utensils must be left in racks to drain and air dry.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>Although dishwashing machines are a boon to us, they can create problems if not selected well. Some of the common causes of failure are:
</div><div>• machines located in the wrong place
</div><div>• improper plumbing
</div><div>•&nbsp; machines are too small
</div><div>•&nbsp; untrained employees
</div><div>• water is not adequately hot
</div><div>•&nbsp; water pressure is low
</div><div>• wrong selection of detergent
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>While selecting a new machine the following points should be kept in mind:
</div><div>•&nbsp; select a machine from a reliable, standard company
</div><div>•&nbsp; two small machines are better than one big one. During slack periods only one machine can be operated, or if one machine breaks down, the other can be used
</div><div>•&nbsp; number of operators required and the kind of technical knowledge they must possess to operate the machine
</div><div>•&nbsp; whether servicing the machines needs outside technicians or can it be serviced by available staff 
</div><div>•&nbsp; the power consumption
</div><div>•&nbsp; clean-ability and durability of the material used and the design
</div><div>•&nbsp; whether the machine is silent or noisy when switched on
</div><div>•&nbsp; whether large trays and glasses can be washed in it
</div><div>•&nbsp; whether it has a detergent feeder fitted in
</div><div>• whether there is a strainer pan to collect food debris

</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Dishwashing operators must take the greatest care while removing sanitised dishes, utensils and equipment’s from racks, baskets or the conveyer itself. Contamination of cleaned and sanitised ware should be avoided.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>General Rules for Hygienic Storage and Handling
</strong></div><div>• There should be clean place for storage of cleaned and sanitised ware. Store all items either on clean dry shelves or in cart racks. Dusty or dirty shelves will quickly re soil cleaned and sanitised items.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Handle items as little as possible, taking care not to touch food or mouth contact surfaces.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Storage area must be dry and above the floor. Splashes from mopping solutions or food spillage, exposure to dust or floor dirt from sweeping must be avoided.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Pans or containers stored on low shelves should be placed inverted or covered.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Utensils etc. should be hung in a self-draining position on hooks or racks.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Glasses and cups should be inverted on racks or on shelves.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Silverware should be placed in perforated plastic containers to dry. Cutlery should be picked up by the handle.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>DISH CLOTH
</strong></div><div>Drying cloths should be used only when necessary. They should be changed frequently and washed and boiled each day. The dish cloths themselves carry many germs and the wise operator will realise that the germs may be passed back onto cleaned and sanitised crockery and utensils. The use of disposable absorbent paper for final drying can be considered, if affordable. Cloths for mopping should, if used, be boiled frequently or soaked overnight in a disinfectant solution.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>CLEANING OF PREMISES &amp; SURROUNDINGS 
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Cleaning Schedule
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Cleanliness is an essential part of the daily routine in all areas and departments in any catering establishment. It is the key to good health and efficient work. The cleaning schedule should be carefully planned so that the premises, all equipment, furniture and surroundings are thoroughly cleaned every day. 
</div><div>The cleaning schedule should not interfere with or hamper the regular working in the establishment. 
</div><div>The cleaners should be familiar with the work programme and should strictly adhere to the time-table. Any spillage or accidental mess should, however, be cleaned up promptly. This will prevent accidents and grease spots forming on floors.
</div><div><br></div><div>A surface is clean when it is free from dust, dirt, grease, stains, cobwebs or any such unacceptable element.
</div><div>
</div><div>To remove soil from any surface it is necessary to select the proper cleaning technique. This will depend on the type of soil present. Soil can be removed by
</div><div>
</div><div>•&nbsp; Sweeping.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Dusting or damp dusting with a cloth tightly wrung in a multipurpose cleaning solution. 
</div><div>•&nbsp; Washing with water and a cleaning agent.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Friction using an abrasive agent.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Suction using a vacuum cleaner or wet pick-up machine.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Pressure using a scrubber or polisher.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Force by using water or air.
</div><div>•&nbsp; Solvents for removing grease and stubborn stains.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>The cleaning schedule should be prepared for daily, weekly and monthly cleaning. Special cleaning, like outside windows, light fixtures, walls which require washing, polishing, distempering and painting of surfaces, is carried out a couple of times a year. The general rule for cleaning is that there should be no large-scale sweeping and cleaning while food is being prepared,  as sweeping raises dust laden with microbes which contaminates food.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1.	Floors 
</strong></div><div>Floors in areas where traffic is heavy, as in kitchens, bakeries, pantries, dishwashing rooms, walk-in refrigerators, corridors, dining rooms, washrooms and toilets, should be cleaned  everyday. Floors in areas where traffic is light can be cleaned weekly.
</div><div>
</div><div>All washable floor surfaces should be washed. Wooden floors should be waxed or polished. Hot water, soap or detergent, a scrubbing brush and a mop is needed. Before cleaning the floor  all movable light equipment and furniture must be shifted. The floor is best washed at the end of the day. Floors in the pantry, larder, dry food store and vegetable store should be swept daily and washed at least once a week. Fixed carpets and matting in dining rooms, passages, stair ways should be brushed or swept every working day, preferably by a vacuum cleaner. Loose mats and rugs should be vacuum cleaned or taken out into the open and beaten at least once a week. Carpets should be shampooed or dry-cleaned at least once a year.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2.	Walls and Ceilings
</strong></div><div>Walls and ceilings should preferably be non-porous and in good repair. This helps the cleaning procedure and prevents pests from breeding in cracks and crevices. While cleaning the walls and ceiling, follow the principle of cleaning the uppermost areas first. Walls, ceilings and fixtures should be cleaned at least once a week. Areas within reach should be dusted every day. The method of cleaning will depend on the surface to be cleaned. Ideally, walls should be washed with warm water and a detergent. The ceilings should be brushed and swept. The girders, piping, electric fittings, etc., should be dusted. Dusting should be done carefully so that dirt is not shifted from one place to another. The best way of removing dust is by using a vacuum cleaner or by damp dusting as it prevents dust from flying about. All walls must be dusted. Walls that become heavily soiled or spattered daily should be washed. All walls should be free of dust, moisture, grease, cobwebs, grime and mildew. Light coloured walls make dirt more visible. Painted walls should be repainted regularly and papered walls should be kept in a good state of repair with no loose paper.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>3.	Kitchen Tables, Counters and Preparation Slabs 
</strong></div><div>Kitchen tables, counters and preparation slabs should be washed at least once a day. All surfaces coming in contact with food should be cleaned after each service by the three bucket method. All metal surfaces should be cleaned with hot water, a non-scratching detergent and by a hand swab. Wooden and marble surfaces should be scrubbed with a scrubbing brush, hot water and detergent. The surfaces should be rinsed well and wiped with a clean cloth every time they are used. Such cloths should be washed well and boiled. 
</div><div>They should not be used for wiping dishes. All parts of tables, including the framework and underside, all areas of the counter, like the hot cupboard, and all preparation areas including chopping boards and pastry slabs should be cleaned at least once a day. The bain-marie (hot food serving counter) should be turned off and the water drained off. It should then be cleaned inside and outside with hot detergent water, rinsed and dried every day.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.	Shelves and Cupboards 
</strong></div><div>Selves and cupboards that are constantly in use should be tidied and cleaned once a week. Shelves and cupboards are mainly used for storing ingredients or utensils. They should be first emptied and then swept or dusted. The upper surfaces of the shelves should be scrubbed and lower surfaces should be dusted. While cleaning, always start with the topmost shelf. Cupboards which are used for storing reserve crockery, linen, etc. i.e. long-term storage cupboards, should be cleared out and cleaned at least once a month.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>5.	Cleaning of Surroundings and Drainage 
</strong></div><div>The entire working premises should be thoroughly cleaned once a week. This should be done after the dining area is closed. All edible items should be covered and put away. All easily movable articles should be removed. This procedure helps in putting things back in place and prevents accumulation of rubbish. Cleaning is thus made easier.
</div><div>
</div><div>All furniture should be thoroughly dusted at least once a day and table tops scrubbed clean. If table cloths are used, they should be changed. Walls, ceilings, fittings and fixtures should be swept or dusted at least once a week.
</div><div>All passages and staircases, whether used to carry food or used by customers, should be cleaned frequently, and any spillage should be mopped up at once. All nooks and corners should be swept out and cleaned thoroughly once a month.
</div><div>Any open space outside the building should be swept and washed every day. No rubbish should be allowed to collect in the drains or else drains will get blocked, give off foul odours and encourage pests.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Drainage 
</strong></div><div>Drains should be adequate to remove all wastewater without being overloaded. Each drain should have a water seal or trap which will prevent unpleasant odours rising from the pipe into the room. Drain pipes should have a diameter of 10 to 15 cms and should be cleaned regularly. They get blocked mostly because food accumulates on the sides and blocks the pipes. Blockages can be cleared by using a rubber water plunger. If not cleared then the cleaning eye at the bottom should be opened. The drain can be cleaned with a flexible wire or a cleaning liquid especially available for blocked drains.
</div><div>
</div><div>Grease traps are necessary because they prevent grease from congealing in the drainpipes &amp; STP. The grease tray should be removed regularly and washed out.
