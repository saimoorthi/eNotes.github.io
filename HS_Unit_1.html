</strong></div><div>Hygiene refers to the set of practices associated with the preservation of health and healthy living. In general, hygiene mostly means practices that prevent the spread of disease-causing harmful microorganisms.

</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Sanitation</strong> 
</div><div>The word sanitation comes from the Latin word sanitas, which means “health”. Sanitation means creating and maintaining hygienic and healthful conditions. It is an applied science and relates physical, chemical, biological, and microbial principles to food, the environment and health. Sanitation is more than just cleanliness. Food or equipment can be free of visible dirt and still be contaminated with microorganisms or chemicals that can cause illness or food spoilage.
</div><div>
</div><div>Sanitary practices and hygienic conditions are becoming more and more important because food is being processed, prepared and sold in larger volumes than before. Some microorganisms cause food spoilage and food-borne illness, but others are beneficial in food processing and preparation. Sanitation can reduce the growth of microorganisms on equipment and dirt on food. This can reduce contamination of food by microorganisms that cause food-borne illness and food spoilage. Sanitary principles also apply to waste disposal and can help reduce pollution and improve ecological balance.
