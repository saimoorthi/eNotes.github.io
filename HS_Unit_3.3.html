            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><div>Cleanliness and sanitation of catering establishments and premises includes not only maintenance of clean and well sanitised surfaces of all equipment in contact with food but also good housekeeping practices and adequate treatment and disposal of wastes.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>In the food industry, wastes must be disposed of regularly and efficiently to prevent contamination of any food product. Wastes arising from catering establishments are broadly classified into three groups: solid wastes (garbage and refuse), liquid wastes (sewage) and gaseous wastes (smoke and fumes).
</div><div>Solid wastes in the form of refuse and garbage is the major waste which arises from the catering industry. They pose a problem in disposal to the caterer. Liquid wastes are normally disposed through sewers provided by the municipality in towns and cities and gaseous wastes are expelled into the atmosphere where they get diluted by diffusion and air currents. It is essential to collect and dispose of all types of waste separately as they are easier to deal with if they are kept separate.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>SOLID WASTES</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>Apart from the usual trash and litter like empty cartons, tins and boxes, solid wastes from the food industry include agricultural wastes like unusable portions of plant and animal foods resulting from food production. Solid wastes should preferably be sorted into biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes, and stored separately. They may be compacted or concentrated before disposal. Agricultural wastes can be used as feed or fertiliser after appropriate treatment.
</div><div>Refuse refers to any waste material, either non-food or swill. Non-food waste from the kitchen includes all cans, bottles, paper bags, polythene bags, lids, cardboard cartons, etc. From the service area, single service items, paper napkins and straws, toothpicks, etc. also contribute significantly to the overall solid waste matter.
</div><div><br></div><div>If waste is allowed to accumulate it is dangerous to health. This is because of the following reasons:
</div><div>1.	Organic portions of solid waste ferments and gives off foul odours
</div><div>2.	Piled up waste favours the breeding of insects and rodents, especially flies
</div><div>3.	Pathogens present in waste may be conveyed to humans through pests and dust.
</div><div>4.	It may pollute the water supply.
</div><div>5.	There is a risk of air pollution in case of accidental or spontaneous combustion of rotting refuse because of the production of gas.
</div><div>6.	Hogs, cattle and dogs feed on garbage and spread it still further.
</div><div>7.	Heaps of refuse lying around is an unattractive sight.	
</div><div><br></div><div>It is therefore necessary that the refuse from catering establishments is properly collected, stored and disposed of in a sanitary manner. If it is not disposed of immediately, then it should be stored in proper containers in a cool place. Garbage should always be kept well away from food, utensils and food preparation, storage and service areas.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Collection
</strong></div><div>Refuse should always be collected from the place where it is produced, i.e. near pre-preparation tables, meat blocks, kitchen sinks, dishwashing area, pantry table, etc. It can be collected in small bins or swill bowls. Nowadays, modern work tables are fitted with garbage bins on a trolley placed underneath the table. The waste can be immediately pushed off the table into the bin.
</div><div>All small bins must be emptied into a large bin outside the kitchen at least twice a day or whenever the bins are full.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Storage of Garbage
</strong></div><div>It is important to store garbage correctly before it is disposed of. It should not be left overnight near the kitchen area. The kitchen area is warmer than the other areas and decay is faster near the kitchen. The ideal storage area is in a yard behind the premises. Garbage should be filled in bins and these bins should be kept in the coolest place. Care should be taken to ensure easy cleaning and absence of pests. The garbage storage area should be large enough for the amount of garbage that will accumulate.
</div><div>In large establishments and places where it is not disposed off frequently, it is stored in the basement at low temperatures.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>The Garbage Bin
</strong></div><div>The garbage bin should have the following characteristics:
</div><div>1.	it should be made of metal, preferably galvanised
</div><div>2.	stoutly constructed and durable
</div><div>3.	painted or treated with bitumen to prevent rusting
</div><div>4.	unridged
</div><div>5.	covered with tightly fitting lids, preferably with a clip to prevent the lid from blowing off.
</div><div>6.	leakproof
</div><div>7.	pestproof
</div><div>8.	easy to clean
</div><div>9.	of the correct size
</div><div>10.	adequate in number
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Cleaning the Bins</strong> Garbage bins may be used in rotation. They should be cleaned often. A tap, a pipe and a drain should be provided near the disposal area. After the bins are emptied they should ideally be rinsed with warm water and scrubbed with a long handled brush using soap and disinfectant. The floors of the disposal area should be clean and free from any spilt refuse.
</div><div>Kitchen waste and plate scrapings should be collected in closed containers or a strong polythene bag or disposable cartons. To check pilferage, transparent bags may be used.
</div><div>After the bag is full, it should be tied up.
</div><div>These can be directly emptied into or placed in the main bins at regular intervals. This waste should never be carried through the dining areas. The containers should always be covered and cleaned thoroughly as soon as they are empty.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Methods of Disposal
</strong></div><div>After refuse is collected, it is important to dispose it off in such a way that it does not create any nuisance.
</div><div>The variety and quantity of waste products to be disposed off has increased tremendously with improvement in the standard of living and the population explosion.
</div><div>Waste arising from catering establishments is mainly composed of biodegradable or organic matter (biomass). This waste needs prompt disposal because it is highly perishable and decomposes rapidly, giving rise to foul odours and encouraging the growth of microorganisms and pests.
</div><div>Before selecting a method for proper disposal of wastes, it is necessary to understand the value of the waste matter which is to be disposed off and the nuisance it is likely to cause if improperly disposed.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>The methods of disposing garbage may be broadly classified as follows.
</div><div>Land-filling, burial, composting, incineration, mechanically disposing, bio gas plants, vermiculture and recycling.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Land filling</strong><br></div><div>Dumping Refuse is dumped in low lying land or in land depressions like pits and hollows for reclaiming low lying land. This is the easiest method of disposing of dry refuse. Bacterial action reduces the volume of the refuse and gradually converts it to humus. This method however, has the following disadvantages:
</div><div>1.	loose refuse may be dispersed by wind
</div><div>2.	garbage is exposed to flies and rodents
</div><div>3.	it is unsightly in appearance and produces an unpleasant smell
</div><div>4.	surface water as well as ground water may get polluted
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Burial </strong>This method is suitable where the volume of garbage produced is small. A trench is prepared to collect the garbage. At the end of the day the refuse is covered with 20 to 30 cm of earth. Alternate layers of refuse and earth are formed. When the trench is filled up till it is only 40 cm deep, it is filled with earth and sealed. A new trench is then dug. Chemical, bacteriological and physical changes occur in the buried refuse. It takes approximately four to six months for complete decomposition of organic matter into an innocuous mass. Temporary food service establishments set up in open areas should dispose of garbage by this method.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Composting</strong> This is a method of combined disposal of refuse and sludge. Sludge is the solid precipitate in the sewage tank which settles at the bottom.
</div><div>Animal and plant wastes are rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can be returned to the soil by composting. Wastes of biological origin contain high amounts of water and are digested anaerobically by microorganisms in the absence of air. The waste is decomposed and stabilised by bacteria and fungi to form a humus like material called compost. Compost is rich in nutrients and fertilises the soil.
</div><div>During this breakdown carbon dioxide, water and heat are produced. The heat produced is over 600C for several days. This destroys larvae and eggs of flies and other pathogenic organisms.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Incineration</strong> It is a hygienic method involving burning of refuse and converting it into harmless waste. It is burned in a specially constructed incinerator. The incinerator should be maintained in perfect working condition.
</div><div>The incinerator should have a tall chimney and sufficient draught of air for efficient combustion, without creating a smoke nuisance.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Disadvantages
</strong></div><div>1.	If refuse does not burn properly, too much offensive smoke is produced which, in turn, pollutes the air.
</div><div> 
</div><div>2.	Organic nitrogen which could have been returned to the soil is converted into inorganic nitrogen and is returned to the atmosphere.
</div><div>3.	This method cannot be used during the rainy season or if the refuse is wet.
</div><div>4.	Although incineration is ideal from the sanitary point of view, it is costly compared to other methods and the fuel and fertiliser value of the waste is lost.
</div><div><br></div><div>Any presence of fine ash makes burning difficult and therefore dust or ash should be stored separately. In this method no manure is formed.
</div><div>The volume of refuse is reduced to one-fourth its original weight. The residue is a mass of hard material called clinkers and is used for road making. The cost of transporting refuse is minimised. This is one of the best methods of garbage disposal.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mechanical Disposers</strong> </div><div>Mechanical disposers include pulpers or disintegrators and mechanical compactors.
</div><div>These can be installed in catering establishments and are useful because they help in reducing the volume of garbage and the number of garbage bins required. These methods require access to a drain, water for cleaning and a power source.
</div><div>Pulpers or disintegrators The latest way of disposing kitchen waste as soon as it is produced is through an automatic garbage disposal machine. This is also the quickest and most hygienic way of garbage disposal.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Disposal of Biodegradable Wastes
</strong></div><div>Bacteria act on organic matter and decompose it either aerobically or anaerobically. In aerobic decomposition complete combustion of organic matter takes place. This happens in vermiculture.
</div><div>In anaerobic decomposition incomplete combustion takes place and is accompanied with the production of methane gas. If anaerobic conditions are created in garbage heaps, ponds or septic tanks, a foul odour emanates because of gas formation. This principle is made use of in the production of biogas. 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Vermiculture</strong> </div><div>Vermiculture is a cheap, practical, innovative technology which conserves the humus content of the soil. This is achieved with the help of the earthworm Pheretima olongata. Aerobic bacteria multiply in the gut of the earthworm and decompose waste like sugars, starch, cellulose and protein into humus and simpler forms which can be easily assimilated by plants. The burrowing action of the worm tills the soil ten times deeper than the traditional plough. It increases porosity and aeration by breaking up the soil.
</div><div>The worm feeds on garbage and excretes it as manure, known as vermicastings, which is a highly enriched kind of biofertiliser and contains hundreds of tiny earthworm cocoons to continue the process. It restores fertility to degraded soils and wastelands. Vermiculture can be done in a garbage bin in the kitchen. All food waste is chopped or crushed and spread in a layer in the bin, or on the soil in garden beds or special beds to which vermicastings have been applied.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Bio-sanitizer
</strong></div><div>The bio sanitizer along with garden waste is yet another way of converting wet biodegradable waste arising from kitchens into rich organic manure. It has been proven to be the simplest, most cost effective, least labour intensive and most environmentally friendly method of converting biodegradable waste into useful good quality manure. This can be done on a large scale in bins or on a smaller scale in a pot or in one corner of the garden.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Advantages
</strong></div><div>1.	The biosanitizer is to be used only once when the bin is started.
</div><div>2.	Sujala is also put in the watering can only once.
</div><div>3.	No turnincy of waste is required.
</div><div>4.	Rich manure can be harvested once a year and the same bin can be re-used.
</div><div>5.	The cost of biosanitizer and Sujala is a one-time investment and is affordable.
</div><div>6.	Garbage can be treated at the source where it is generated and there is no dependency for its storage and disposal.
</div><div>7.	Enriched, organic manure is obtained instead of allowing garbage to spread and rot in the bins or on streets.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Bio gas&nbsp;Generation</strong> </div><div>Human excreta, animal droppings and plant and agricultural wastes can be processed in a biogas or gobar gas plant to produce fuel gas and rich manure. The plant consists of a circular tank shaped like a well. The tank is divided into two sections by a partition wall. It is covered on top by a cylindrical dome for the collection of gas.
</div><div><br></div><div>The two main products formed by anaerobic digestion are
</div><div>1.	fuel gas, which is approximately 55 per cent methane and 45 per cent carbon dioxide
</div><div>2.	manure, which is rich in nitrogen and humus.
</div><div><br></div><div>The gas produced can be used for cooking, lighting and running engines. Many companies are working towards large-scale production of biogas and manure from refuse collected by municipal corporations.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Recycling</strong></div><div>Recycling is the reprocessing of waste products so that they can be re-used.
</div><div>Recycling food waste One way of utilising the energy from waste food is by using it as feed for pigs and poultry. It should be collected separately, taking care not to mix other refuse like cans, broken glass, etc. Waste food may be used for preparation of poultry feed after it is boiled well, shredded, dried and enriched with minerals. Destruction of all pathogens should be ascertained, otherwise they may find their way into the flesh of animals and ultimately reach the food consumed by humans. Recycling non-biodegradable waste All kinds of glass, plastic, polythene, paper and metal can be recycled. Each of these items should be collected in separate containers or bags and sent for recycling. This will drastically reduce the volume of garbage to be disposed off daily and indirectly reduce pollution.
</div><div>The use of recycled plastics is, however, not permitted in the food industry.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>LIQUID WASTES OR SEWAGE
</strong></div><div>Liquid wastes or sewage includes wastewater from sinks and drains from the kitchen, dishwashing areal laundry, bathrooms, toilets and other drains from the building and yard which is normally carried away by underground sewers.
</div><div>It contains human excreta, chemicals like detergents, pesticides and oil and clean up wastewater rich in nutrients from animal and vegetable foods. It is one of the most dangerous sources of human pathogens and should not come in contact with food, water, utensils, equipment or any other food contact surface.
</div><div>Sewage must be kept separate from other wastes because of the possible presence of human intestinal pathogens and the importance of guaranteeing their destruction. Disposal of sewage in a sanitary manner thus forms a pre-requisite for good food sanitation.
</div><div>As far as possible, sewage should be disposed of in a public sewerage system or in a manner approved by the health authority. Care should be taken to prevent contamination of the ground and water supply and to keep all pests away. The temporary food service establishment operator needs to take special care. 
</div><div>In catering establishments located in towns and cities, sewage is removed through a system of underground sewers and drains called the water carriage system. These sewers take the sewage to a far off place away from the city. Before it is disposed of, it is treated in sewage treatment disposal farms or modern sewage treatment plants.
</div><div>If the water carriage system is not available, sewage is treated in specially constructed septic tanks. Sewage should be treated before it is disposed of to reduce the possibilities of pollution and contamination.
</div><div>Kitchen and wash up area wastewater should not be allowed to stagnate, if sewers or drains are not available. This water could be filtered and drained into the subsoil through a simple soakpit.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Plumbing
</strong></div><div>Proper plumbing in a sanitary manner is essential to good food sanitation as it prevents sewage contamination of food in preparation and storage areas. 
</div><div>Problems commonly encountered with faulty plumbing are:
</div><div><br></div><div>1.	leak in sewer pipes
</div><div>2.	cross-connections with potable water pipes
</div><div>3.	back flow of raw sewage
</div><div>4.	blockages or choked pipes
</div><div><br></div><div>Plumbing is necessary to safely carry sewage and liquid wastes from the catering establishment to the sewage disposal system and prevent any problems leading to contamination of food and water.
</div><div> 
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>GASEOUS WASTES
</strong></div><div> 
</div><div>Gaseous wastes include strong fumes originating from food being cooked and smoke from the kitchen, especially when wood or coal is used as cooking fuel. Gaseous wastes are a problem in the tandoori and barbecue sections of the Indian kitchen.
