</div><div>1. Causes of Damp Wall
</div><div>2. Effects of Dampness in Wall
</div><div>3. Remedies.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Causes of Damp Wall:
</strong></div><div>There are various causes of ingress of moisture in walls which make them damp:
</div><div>i. Defective roof-leakage is a major source of water entering the wall and making it damp.
</div><div>ii. Porous bricks used in construction is a permanent source of dampness in walls as they attract
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">moisture.&nbsp;</span></div><div>iii. Bad materials used in construction are also a source of damp wall.
</div><div>iv. Vegetation – Growth of vegetation in the wall indicates presence of moisture or water without
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">which it could not grow. Vegetation develops further cracks in a wall already having cracks and cause&nbsp;</span>leakage<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;in the wall.&nbsp;</span></div><div>v. Earth backing against wall – Dumping of earth against wall causes dampness in it.
</div><div>vi. Cavities, holes left in the wall due to negligence and dab-holes kept for erection of scaffolding and
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">later not filled properly with concrete are a prospective source of attracting and storing moisture.&nbsp;</span></div><div>vii. Mortar joints not laid properly and uniformly are sources of attracting moisture.
</div><div>viii. The worst source of moisture ingress in building wall is the defective damp proof course.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Decayed, dilapidated or defectively laid damp proof course, i.e., failure of the damp proof course to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">arrest rising of moisture from below causes dampness in wall.&nbsp;</span></div><div>ix. Earth banks – Construction of earthen bank by the side of a building, side slope covering some
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">height of the wall above damp proof course would cause dampness in wall.&nbsp;</span></div><div>x. Splashing of rain off the ground on the wall above the damp proof course which happens when the
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">plinth height is low or there be ground nearby with higher level.&nbsp;</span></div><div>xi. Defective window sills allowing stagnation of water on it.
</div><div>xii. Sloping ground – This generally happens in hill areas, where buildings are constructed on the
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">slopes of the hills.&nbsp;</span></div><div>xiii. Dampness in hollow walls is caused due to deposit of mortar droppings during construction and
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">lack of ventilation.&nbsp;</span></div><div>xiv. Leaking pipes – Soil, waste water, rain water, or water supply pipes allowing water to enter the
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">walls.&nbsp;</span></div><div>xv. Salt in the plaster – Presence of salt in the plaster or precisely in sand used for plaster will render
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">the wall damp.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Effects of Dampness in Wall:
</strong></div><div>There are many injurious effects which are a direct result of dampness in walls of buildings:
</div><div>i. Unhygienic condition inside the building – inviting various diseases to the inmates.
</div><div>ii. Decay – The action of moisture on the different portions of the structure induce decay and
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">disintegration of materials like bricks, stone, steel, timber, etc. as continuous presence of moisture in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the portions causes growth of moss, fungus and corrosion.&nbsp;</span></div><div>iii. Dry rot – The presence of moisture in timber causes the disease in the timber, termed dry rot. 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Dry rot is effective due to presence of a virulent type of fungus allied to mushroom type.&nbsp;</span></div><div>iv. Disintegration – Continued presence of moisture in brick may cause mechanical injury to the wall.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">If there are cracks in the wall or porosity which may retain water in freezing temperature, the water&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">will freeze, increase in volume and cause severe damage.&nbsp;</span></div><div>v. Efflorescence – It is produced by the entrance of moisture in the brickwork which usually contains
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">various soluble salts. These salts are dissolved by the water and issuing from the pores of the bricks,&nbsp;they </span>crystallize<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;and cause disintegration of bricks.&nbsp;</span></div><div>vi. Furniture – They are damaged due to continuous damp environment.
</div><div>vii. Decoration of timber, bamboo, wall papering, etc. get damaged.
</div><div>viii. Warping and decay of timber.
</div><div>ix. Plaster getting soft and subsequently crumbling.
</div><div>x. Corrosion of metal.
</div><div>xi. Damage to electrical installations and short circuiting.
</div><div>xii. Deterioration of floor covering.
</div><div>xiii. Infestation of termite.
</div><div>xiv. Blistering, flaking and bleaching of paint.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Remedies to Damp Wall:
</strong></div><div>Remedies to damp wall may be temporary or permanent according to the exigency. Again, treatment
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">to remove dampness would be different for internal and external walls.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Temporary Remedies:</strong></div><div><em><strong>Temporary remedies for internal walls:</strong></em></div><div><em><strong><br></strong></em></div><div><em><strong>
</strong></em></div><div><strong>1. Application of bituminous painting:
</strong></div><div>The affected wall is to be cleaned, allowed to be dried and then a coat of hot bitumen applied
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">uniformly. However, if there be difficulty in applying hot bitumen, bituminous compound emulsions&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">are available in the market which may be applied cold with brush.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>2. Painting with water proofing solution:
</strong></div><div>Either commercially available such solutions or prepared solution as described later may be applied as
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">prescribed after cleaning the surface.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>3. Applying cement wash:
</strong></div><div>This is an easy method. Cement and water mixed in thin consistency with admixture of adhesive gum
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">may be applied one or more coats after cleaning the surface.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>Temporary Remedies for External Walls:
</strong></div><div>1. Applying water proofing solutions as mentioned above.
</div><div>2. Coating with boiled linseed oil or commercially available linseed oil may be boiled and applied hot
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">with brush after cleaning the surface.&nbsp;</span></div><div>3. Applying cement wash as mentioned above.
</div><div>4. Sylvester’s Process – Applying alternate coats of soap and alum solutions to the walls where they
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">will sink into the pores just below the surface. The first coat to be applied after cleaning the surface.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Subsequent coats to be applied after the previous coat have dried up.&nbsp;</span></div><div>5. Painting paraffin – Paraffin oil may be painted over the affected surface after cleaning. 
</div><div>6. Applying bituminous paint as mentioned above. Application of bitumen or bituminous paint on
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">walls internal or external though may be effective, will render the wall surface look unpleasant.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Permanent Remedies:
</strong></div><div>Before selecting a method for permanent remedy against dampness in walls, the cause of dampness,
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">shall have to be investigated.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Once the cause is established, the action to be taken for remedial measure would not be difficult. The
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">main object would be to remove the cause. In most of the cases, removal would not be difficult.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As for example:&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>1. Dampness due to leakage from the roof – Stop the roof leakage.
</div><div>2. Vegetation – Removal of the vegetation including uprooting and applying chemical solution so that
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">growth may not recur and sealing if there be any crack.&nbsp;</span></div><div>3. Earth backing, bank, sloping ground, etc. – The space around the building need be dressed to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">avoid splashing of water on the wall.&nbsp;</span></div><div>4. Cavities, holes, etc. – Detect the exact spot, open the space and fill the cavity with concrete.
</div><div>5. Defective window sills – These are to be corrected.
</div><div>6. Dampness in hollow walls – The main purpose of constructing hollow walls is defeated. Utmost
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">care must be taken during construction to avoid dropping of mortar. The outer leaf of the wall which&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">is a non-load bearing, may be opened partially for removing the dropped mortar and cleaning.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Further, weep holes may be provided below horizontal damp proof course and air bricks may be&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">provided at suitable places for ventilation.&nbsp;</span></div><div>7. Salt in plaster – This is due to using bad quality sand during construction. In such case, there is
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">no other alternative than to remove the plaster and apply new rendering with salt free sand.&nbsp;</span></div><div>8. Leaking pipes – The location need be traced correctly. These mainly happen in cases of soil and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">waste water pipes, when the pipes from inside the building pass through the wall for coming out. In&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">most cases, there are joints at these locations.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These joints need be opened up from outside and the joints or leaks repaired. As the pipe is in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">horizontal position, the joint must be lead caulked. In cases of rain water pipes, probable location is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">at the intake mouth at roof level or just below.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In such case, the location need be opened carefully and the joint repaired with sand and cement&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">mortar. In cases of water supply pipes, if the pipes laid are exposed, locating the leakage is not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">difficult.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In cases of concealed pipes, the identification of the location is not much difficult as the dampness in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the wall would indicate the position. The spot need be opened and the leak repaired.&nbsp;</span></div><div>9. In cases of dampness due to use of porous bricks and bad materials, the solution would be to
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">demolish the portions and reconstruct those portions with better bricks and materials. If this is not&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">possible due to economic reasons, the remedy would be to remove the plaster from either side and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">then re-plaster with new mortar of richer proportion with admixture of water-proofing compound.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The external plaster should be in two layers, the first layer should be laid over the brick surface after&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">cleaning and raking the joints. 20 mm thick cement sand plaster, 1: 4 over which the second layer of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">plaster 10 mm thick, 1: 3 to be laid with admixture of water proofing compound. The internal plaster&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">should be single layer 20 mm thick cement and sand 1: 4.&nbsp;</span></div><div>10. In cases of mortar joints not laid properly – This is a construction defect. The plaster on both the
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">faces should be removed. The mortar joints should be opened up to 20 mm deep and raked properly&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and then re-plastered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>11. Damp proof course – Damp proofing of a building is achieved by using suitable damp proofing
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">material which should satisfy the condition to be impervious to the moisture.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Now, due to absence of damp proof course or due to bad construction if the damp proof course&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">provided does not satisfy the condition above and moisture rises through the damp proof course and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">the walls get damp and consequently other ills appear, the commonest method in dealing with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">wet rising from the soil by capillary action is insertion of a new damp proof course or replacing the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">old one.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The simple method is to remove two layers of bricks right through the thickness of the wall at the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">damp proof course level. The bottom course is then replaced, after being reduced in thickness equal&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">to the thickness of the proposed damp proof course to provide room for insertion of the damp proof&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">course.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When the lower course has been replaced, it should be covered with a bed of cement mortar 12 mm&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">thick so as to get a uniform bearing all over. Over this, the damp proof course made of cement&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">concrete 1: 1 ½ : 3 with admixture of water proofing compound is to be laid. Then the remaining&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">course of brick is replaced.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>They must be well buttered with cement mortar, and after being pushed into the opening, they can
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">be wedged down into intimate contact with the damp proof course tightly into the top bed joint.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The operation should be carried out from the outside and in segments of 1.0 m to 1.2 m in length.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Alternate segments are to be taken up. The whole process should be carried out slowly and with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">precision.&nbsp;</span></div></div>
