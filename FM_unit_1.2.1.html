</strong></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Washing soda process
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>The chemical formula of washing soda is Na2C03. The reactions that take place on adding washing soda solution to hard water are as follows:
</div><div><br></div><div>Na2CO3 +CaSO4 -----------&gt; CaCO3  ðŸ¡«+ Na2SO4
</div><div>Na2CO3 + MgCI2 -----------&gt; MgCO3 ðŸ¡« + 2NaCI
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Caustic soda process
</strong></div><div>Caustic soda can be used to remove both carbonate (temporary) and non-carbonate (permanent) hardness. Calcium and magnesium hydrogen carbonates react with caustic soda to produce insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide.
</div><div>
</div><div>2NaOH + MgSO4-----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ðŸ¡«+ Na2SO4
</div><div>2NaOH+ CaCl2 -----------&gt; Ca(OH)2 ðŸ¡«+ 2NaCl
</div><div>2NaOH + Mg(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; Mg(OH)2 ðŸ¡«+ 2Na2CO3+2H20
</div><div>2NaOH+Ca(HCO3)2 -----------&gt; CaCO3 ðŸ¡«+ 2Na2CO3 + H2o
</div><div>
</div><div>From the above reactions, we find that this process not only removes permanent hardness but also temporary hardness. This process is very efficient for low alkalinity water.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Ion exchange by resin or demineralization process for removing hardness</strong>
</div><div>There are many pieces of equipment in industry, such as water boiler and other process equipment and scientific apparatus, which would need water free of any minerals. The process by which the minerals are removed is known as  demineralization (DM) and the plant is known as DM plant. Since this process helps us in completely removing or reducing the mineral content to any desired  extent, it is very suitable for producing water of any desired hardness or even mineral free water. The demineralized water is sometimes called deionized water and is as pure as distilled water.
</div><div>The process consists of passing the water through cation exchange resins, which produce almost similar effects as are produced in the zeolite method, except that hydrogen (instead of sodium) is exchanged for the basic metallic ions. The cation exchange resins in fact are phenol aldehyde condensation products.
</div><div>
</div><div>Their chemical formula may be represented by H2R, which represents the hydrogen ion and R represents the organic part of the substance.
</div><div>
</div><div>Ca(HCO3)2 + H2R -----------&gt; CaR +2H2O+2CO2
</div><div>Na2CO3+H2R -----------&gt; Na2R + H2O + CO2
</div><div>
</div><div>Thus, we find that these cation exchange resins exchange sodium ions also, which come out of the water forming exchanged resin (Na2R), making water free from minerals. However, absolutely pure water can be very corrosive if it comes in contact with air, thus absorbing oxygen from it as this water has a strong affinity for oxygen.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Calgon softener
</strong></div><div>Calgon is the trade name of a complex salt, sodium hexametaphosphate (NaP03)6. It is used for softening hard water. Calgon ionizes to give a complex anion, which subsequently combines with Ca and Mg ions in hard water.
</div><div><br></div><div>(NaPO3)6 or Na2 (Na4P6O18).        2Na + Na4P6O2(18)
</div><div>The addition of Calgon to hard water causes the calcium and magnesium ions of hard water to displace sodium ions from the anion of Calgon according to the following reaction:
</div><div>
</div><div>Caso4 +Na2 (Na4P6O18) -----------&gt; Na2SO4 + Ca (Na4P6O18)
</div><div>
</div><div>This results in the removal of calcium and magnesium ions from hard water in the form of a complex compound with Calgon. The water is, thus, softened. Sodium salts are released into water without causing any hardness. It is being dosed into water used for washing machine, dyeing work, etc.
</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>
Zeolite (or permutit) or base exchange or cation exchange process
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Hardness can be very effectively and economically removed by using a chemical called zeolite. Zeolite (a green salt generally termed as green sand) is a naturally available salt (Na2O, AI2O3, 4SiO2, 2H2O) which reacts with salts in hard water and forms insoluble salts of Ca and Mg. This is also manufactured synthetically and the white coloured salt is sold under the name of 'Permutit' which is, chemically, hydrated sodium aluminium orthosilicate, having the formula Na2[(AIO2)2(SiO2)2]. xH20 .
</div><div>Permutit is manufactured from naturally available feldspar, kaoline clay, and soda. In chemical equations, we use the short form of the chemical as sodium zeolite (Na2Z) where Z represents [(A102)2 (Si02)2]. 
</div><div>Hence, the process of removing hardness by using this chemical is known as zeolite process as well as 'permutit process'. Any salt has a positively charged part (or cations) and negatively charged part (or anions). Usually, the metallic part of the salt is cation (also called base). For example, in calcium carbonate, calcium is the base or cation and carbonate is the anion. These zeolites have the excellent property of exchanging their cations (sodium) with those (calcium and magnesium) in hard water, which enables them to perform the softening operation. The sodium ions of the zeolite get replaced by the calcium and magnesium ions present in hard water, forming insoluble calcium zeolite and magnesium zeolite.
</div><div>
</div><div>Softening reaction
</div><div>Na2Z     +.   Ca or Mg Salt --------------&gt; Na2 Salt + Ca or Mg zeolite
</div><div>
</div><div>After a few days of operation, all the active sodium zeolite should change to used calcium and magnesium zeolite. However, calcium and magnesium zeolite can be converted back into active sodium zeolite by reacting it with 10 per cent solution of sodium chloride (common table salt solution). 
</div><div>This process is known as regeneration. The exchange reaction that takes place during regeneration can be represented as follows:
</div><div>
</div><div>Regeneration Reaction
</div><div>
</div><div>CaZ/MgZ.  +2NaCI --------------&gt; Na2Z + CaCI2/MgCI2
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Working of a zeolite softening plant 
</strong></div><div>A zeolite softener (or a cation exchange unit) resembles a sand filter in which the filtering medium is a zeolite rather than sand, as shown in image. The hard water enters through the top as shown in the figure and is evenly distributed on the entire zeolite bed. As the hard water passes through the bed, reactions as given above take place and the softened water is collected through the strainers at the base. The zeolite bed is increasingly depleted in its active sodium zeolite content with increasing proportion of Ca and Mg zeolite, When a significant portion of the sodium in the zeolite has been replaced by calcium and magnesium, softening process is stopped by stopping flow of hard water and regeneration operation is started first by washing the bed with good soft water and then passing per cent solution of brine through the bed. The excess brine solution retained in the zeolite, as well as the soluble Ca and Mg chloride salts removed from the activated zeolite bed, after the treatment, are removed by again washing them with good soft water. 
</div><div> 
</div><div>The regenerated zeolite is now ready and can be used afresh for softening. 
</div><div>The rate of filtration through a zeolite softener is about 300 litres per square metre per minute.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Advantages of zeolite process
</strong></div><div>The advantages of zeolite process are as follows:
</div><div>â€¢	Zero hardness can be obtained and have specific uses in textile industries boilers, etc.
</div><div>â€¢	The plants are compact, automatic, and easy to operate.
</div><div>â€¢	The Running, Maintenance, and Operation (RMO) cost is quite less.
</div><div>â€¢	It also removes iron and manganese from water.
</div><div>â€¢	There is no problem in treating water of varying quality
