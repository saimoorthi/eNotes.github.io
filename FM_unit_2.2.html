</div><div>• Revision of contract fees in subsequent years often leads to escalation of total cost if not properly negotiated and controlled.
</div><div>• Often the specialized nature of the maintenance would lead to high charges for such contracts leading to a overall increase in maintenance cost compared to if it were maintained in house.
</div><div>• At the time of bidding, lack of initiative on the part of the Chief Engineer would often lead to a non-competitive price quote by a handful on contractors.
</div><div>• Reduction in the number of specialized in-house maintenance crew may result in their unavailability in case of an emergency requirement for some other facility.
</div><div>• The Chief Engineer does not get any information feedback regarding the status of the equipment under contract maintenance, except in case when it completely breaks down.
</div><div>• Loss of control over contractor employees.
