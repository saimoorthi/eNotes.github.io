&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Conservation is the philosophy that natural resources should be used cautiously so that they will remain available for future generations of people. In practice, conservation is the act of protecting, managing, and restoring shared earth resources such as soil, air, forests, minerals, petroleum, wildlife, and water one of humans' most essential resources. 
</div><div>Conservation generally involves managing natural resources to serve people, whether by providing materials for essential needs (water, food, shelter, and energy) and consumer products (cars, clothing, computers, furniture), or simply by protecting wild areas where people can enjoy nature and outdoor recreation. While most scientists do not argue with using Earth's natural resources to meet human needs, most scientists also agree with the general idea that shared natural resources should be protected from overuse and pollution, and wisely managed using sound scientific information.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Need For Water Conservation
</strong></div><div>Water is Earth's most plentiful natural resource. It covers almost three-quarters of our planet's surface. Astronauts say Earth looks like a "blue marble" from space with its blue oceans and white swirls of water droplets (clouds) in the atmosphere (mass of air surrounding Earth). Water is also a renewable resource. Water moves endlessly within the hydro-logic cycle, and is almost never destroyed in the process. When humans draw water from lakes, rivers, oceans, or groundwater reservoirs (aquifers), new water replaces it. Water is even self-cleansing. When it evaporates, it leaves pollution and salts behind and forms clouds that produce fresh rainwater. New water that flows into polluted lakes and rivers acts to dilute (lower the concentration or amount) and disperse (spread out) pollutants.
</div><div>•	Ninety-seven % of all water on the earth is salt water, which is not suitable for drinking.
</div><div>•	Only 3% of water on Earth is fresh water, and only 0.5% is available for drinking.
</div><div>•	The other 2.5% of fresh water is locked in ice caps, glaciers, the atmosphere, soil, or under the earth's surface, or is too polluted for consumption.
</div><div>With growing population rates and such a small percentage of all the water on Earth fit for consumption, it only makes sense that we must preserve and conserve this precious resource. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Did you know that nearly 1 billion people, mostly in the developing world, have no access to safe water? More than double this number - about 2.4 billion - has no access to any form of improved sanitation facilities. They could use your help to get it.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Reasons to Conserve Water
</strong></div><div>Below are some of the main reasons it is important to conserve water.
</div><div>•	It minimizes the effects of drought and water shortages. Even though our need for fresh water sources is always increasing because of population and industry growth, the supply we have stays constant. Even though water eventually returns to Earth through the water cycle, it's not always returned to the same spot, or in the same quantity and quality. By reducing the amount of water we use, we can better protect against future drought years.
</div><div>•	It guards against rising costs and political conflict. Failing to conserve water can eventually lead to a lack of an adequate water supply, which can have drastic consequences. These include rising costs, reduced food supplies, health hazards, and political conflict.
</div><div>•	It helps to preserve our environment. Reducing our water usages reduces the energy required to process and deliver it to homes, businesses, farms, and communities, which, in turn, helps to reduce pollution and conserve fuel resources.
</div><div>•	It makes water available for recreational purposes. It's not just swimming pools, spas, and golf courses that we have to think about. Much of our freshwater resources are also used for beautifying our surroundings—watering lawns, trees, flowers, and vegetable gardens, as well as washing cars and filling public fountains at parks. Failing to conserve water now can mean losing out on such uses later on.
</div><div>•	It builds safe and beautiful communities: Fire-fighters, hospitals, gas stations, street cleaners, health clubs, gyms, and restaurants all require large amounts of water to provide services to the community. Reducing our usage of water now means that these services can continue to be provided.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Water Conservation in Hotel 
</strong></div><div>The first thing to do if you want to understand how to lower your water bill is to conduct something called a water audit. A water audit is a process to figure out how much water your business is using and exactly where it’s all going. Though the best way to get accurate results is to hire an energy consulting firm, this can be done in a more general way by yourself and/or your staff. If you choose to conduct your own water audit, you should start by looking at two things: your previous water bills and your water meter(s).
</div><div>Understand the Flow
</div><div>Once you have an idea of your usage rates you want to dig deeper to find out where that lump sum of water is actually flowing. From there, you can move on to deciding how to conserve water. To do that, you need usage information from each and every fixture and appliance in your hotel that uses water. Here’s list to get you started:
</div><div>•	Sinks
</div><div>•	Faucets
</div><div>•	Showers
</div><div>•	Toilets
</div><div>•	Dishwashers
</div><div>•	Washing Machines
</div><div>•	Ice Machines
</div><div>•	Cooling Towers (part of your HVAC System)
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hotel Restrooms
</strong></div><div>•	Low flow and high efficiency toilets will save you money immediately. REMEMBER: Dual-flush toilets should be equipped with posted instructions so that everyone understands how to use them!
</div><div>•	Have sink aerators installed; these reduce the flow of water by 1.5 gallons/minute.
</div><div>•	Install shower heads that regulate flow; 2.5 gallons/minute or less will not bother your guests, while saving you big time.
</div><div>•	Install motion activated sensors for hotel sinks and restroom facilities. This not only controls the amount of time water is used, but your guests will appreciate hands-free options.
</div><div>•	Install timers in your hotel showers. This is a gentle reminder to guests to be conscious of water conservation.
</div><div>•	Many urinals are no-flush, but there are new energy efficient models on the market which may provide a more pleasant user experience.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hotel Kitchen
</strong></div><div>•	Upgrade to ENERGY STAR® rated equipment. This alone will reduce water usage by approximately 10%.
</div><div>•	Install sink aerators to reduce the flow of water to 2.5 gallons/minute or less.
</div><div>•	Install pedal operated faucets. This will reduce the ability for staff to turn on a faucet and walk away while leaving it running.
</div><div>•	Turn off continuous flow water streams when not in immediate use.
</div><div>•	Pre-soak dishes.
</div><div>•	Only run fully loaded dish racks through the washer.
</div><div>•	Defrost food in refrigerators instead of under running water. With just a bit of foresight, you will save thousands of gallons/year by eliminating this unnecessary cost.
</div><div>•	Wash vegetables in water basins rather than under running water.
</div><div>•	Fix leaky water lines immediately.
</div><div>•	Educate your staff about water usage and encourage them to be conscious of how they use water.
</div><div>•	Install food traps or compost food waste, rather than automatically and excessively using your garbage disposal which requires running water to work properly.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Hotel Landscaping
</strong></div><div>•	Water your hotel landscape 2 to 3 times a week instead of every day.
</div><div>•	Remove weeds and other unwanted plants to preserve water for your desired landscape.
</div><div>•	Do not over-fertilize or over-prune plants to avoid overstimulated growth.
</div><div>•	Avoid hosing down hotel sidewalks, parking lots and driveways, unless absolutely necessary.
</div><div>•	Install soil moisture override systems and timers on hotel sprinkler systems.
</div><div>•	Time watering when evaporation is the lowest: early morning or evenings are the key.
</div><div>•	Make sure irrigation equipment applies water evenly; if it’s watering anything other than the lawn and garden, it’s wasting your money.
</div><div>•	Use mulch around plants to help avoid evaporation and keep weeds to a minimum.
</div><div>•	Install drip irrigation instead of sprinkler systems.
</div><div>•	Install rain sensors on your sprinkler system so you don’t end up watering in the rain!
</div><div>•	Install rain barrels or other water catchment systems to catch water as it falls from the sky for free for later use in landscape watering.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>A Few More …..
</strong></div><div>•	Sweep floors whenever possible to clean them. Avoid washing down sidewalks and surfaces with hoses, which waste a lot of water in this application.
</div><div>•	Consider switching your mopping system to the water broom, a new technology that saves water while delivering maximum cleaning power.
</div><div>•	Conduct an audit of your housecleaning staff and their procedures and keep an eye out for excessive water usage during cleaning.
</div><div>•	Discourage water-wasting practices in the housekeeping staff, like using the bathtub as a mopping station.
</div><div>•	Switch your hotel’s carpet cleaning process from wet to dry.
</div><div>•	Have windows cleaned on an as-needed basis, as opposed to a set schedule which may be unnecessary.
</div><div>•	Consider switching any water cooled equipment to air cooled – in addition to your ice machines this could include air compressors and refer condensers.
