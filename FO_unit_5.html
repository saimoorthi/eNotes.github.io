        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><div>It is the moral and legal responsibility of a hotel to protect its guests and their property against threats posed by human beings with a conscious intent to harm them. The security department of the hotel is responsible for the overall security of the building, in-house guests, visitors, day users, and employees of the hotel. Guests hold the hotel responsible for their safety and can file for compensation in case of a security lapse in the hotel's security measures.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Hotel Security Staff and System
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>A hotel's security staff may include in-house security personnel and contracted security officer’s. Hotels generally prefer ex-army or ex-police officials as their officer’s because they are already well versed with various security aspects and have a lot of experience in the field. Security responsibilities may include patrolling the property, monitoring surveillance equipment and, in general ensuring that the guests, visitors and employees are safe and secure. The security department is responsible for establishing the details of room keys security, fire safety systems, emergency evacuation plans, and emergency communication plans. The effectiveness  of the security department depends upon the cooperation and assistance of the local law enforcement officials. The security personnel should be trained to handle situations like vandalism, terrorist attacks, and bomb threats and also be trained to prevent and fight fire.
</div><div>
</div><div>Every hotel should have a proper security system to protect its guests, employees,  and their properties. Hotels take measures like installing closed circuit televisions in public areas for proper surveillance, ensuring proper lighting of public areas, and fencing of the hotel property. and positioning security guards at entry gates for the safety and security of their guests and their belongings. Hiring an independent security agency to routinely check the security systems also helps in ensuring the  safety and security of guests.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Role of Front Office
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;A Front desk professional is required to assume a variety of roles during a variety of hours during a workday —chief among  being a gatekeeper, communications expert, phone wiz trouble shooter and receptionist. As a hotel's first contact with guests,  vendors, visitors, and delivery people, the front office staff is the eyes and ears of  the organization. It is up to them to spot potential troublemakers, identify red-flag behaviours, prevent breaches of security, and act with confidence and authority  when situations threaten to get out of hand.
</div><div>
</div><div>A security programme would be effective if all the hotel employees participate in the hotel's security efforts .The front office personnel play a vital  role in assisting the hotel's security personnel to carry out their tasks efficiently. The front office employees like door attendants, parking attendants, bell boys, and receptionists should observe all the people who are entering or leaving the hotel premises and if they notice any suspicious activity or circumstances, they should immediately report the same to the security personnel.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>SAFE DEPOSIT</strong>
</div><div>
</div><div>Though the hotel is not responsible for the guest valuables, the rule to this effect is written in the guest registration card and also notified in the guest room. But a hotel offers a free safe deposit facility for his valuables.
</div><div>
</div><div>Hotels have bank type of lockers installed at the front office cashier. A locker is allotted to guests that can be opened by using two keys. The master key is with the front office cashier and another key is issued to the guest. A contract is also signed in between the guest and the hotel. Whenever a guest wants to open that locker it has to be entered into the locker operating register. Signatures are always verified with the specimen. Head cashier inserts his key then a guest inserts his own key, and then only a lock can be opened. Guest is left alone to operate his locker. Guests can lock the locker with their own key. At the time of departure the guest is asked to vacate the locker.
</div><div>
</div><div>If the key is lost by the guest, then the locker will be drilled open in presence of the guest and can be charged for the replacement of the locker.
</div><div>
</div><div>If the forgets to vacate the locker, he or she has to be informed by the hotel to come and vacate it either personally or by sending an authorized person with an authority letter.
</div><div>
</div><div>These days some hotels have installed an electronic safe deposit box in each guest room. This safety box can be operated by using an electronic number. Guests can use any number to open the lock. The number selected by the guest becomes the locker’s code number and the guests are advised to keep their valuables in the electronic safety box. Though the hotel is not responsible for any lost items. But hotels take this issue as a prestige issue So an inquiry is done on the hotel security level.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Key Control
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>It is the duty and responsibility of the front desk staff to ensure the right guest is given the key to his room and his safety and security pertaining to issuance of key is not compromised or violated during his stay in the hotel.
</div><div>
</div><div>A Front Desk Agent should never give keys, room numbers, messages, parcels or mails to any person without first requiring appropriate identification.
</div><div>
</div><div>For Security reasons hotels use at least three types of keys, Emergency Key, Master key and guest room keys. Types of keys used may vary hotel by hotel but the process of handling them remains pretty much the same.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>When Guest Request for room key:
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>• Request for Guest’s last name and room number.
</div><div>• Cross check the information given by guests against the reservation details on the hotel software (PMS).
</div><div>• If there any mismatch is the details provided then request for any valid photo identification like passport, Driving license, government ID cards etc. </div><div>• Do not handover the room keys without proper authentication of the guest identity.
</div><div>• If no picture identification is available by the guests, the Front office assistant must accompany the guests to the room to confirm the identity. When being challenged by our actions, we are to inform the guest:
</div><div><strong><em>“We are doing this for your security and safety. We appreciate your understanding.”
</em></strong></div><div>• Only in an emergency situation can we use the information on the guest passport number, date of birth, address given to the hotel on arrival etc. to ascertain the computer’s record.
</div><div>• When in doubt with the identity and the guest refused to be escorted to the room, inform the Front office manager immediately. If the Team Leader or Assistant Manager – Front Office could recognize the guest, give the duplicate key to the guest while reinforcing politely why we need to perform the identity check.
</div><div>• Check if the guest requires an additional key or if he has lost his previous key.
</div><div>• If a guest requests an additional key, program a new key with duplicate code.
</div><div>• If a guest has lost his previous key, program a key with new code.
</div><div>• Present the new key to the guest
</div><div>
</div><div>Keys must never be issued to persons claiming to have the guest’s permission to enter the room unless the guest has personally given his /her verbal or written authorization to the Front Office team.
</div><div>
</div><div>Room numbers should not be written on the keys in case keys are misplaced. A set of codes are encoded to differentiate keys being held by guests.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>On Staff’s request entry into occupied room:
</strong></div><div>Only designated operational staff is allowed access to occupied guest rooms. They are: Bellboys, Concierge, Front Desk agents, Housekeeping Manager, Assistant Manager– Housekeeping / Team Leader / Designated Room Attendant and Laundry Attendant, Mini Bar, F&amp;B – Room Service Fruits Deliverer.
</div><div>Key machines should constantly be in ‘log off” mode. Access code should be known only to those designated personnel and not shared among other staff.
</div><div>Cashier may hand over the checked out room key to the bellman to collect luggage and check mini-bar and safe boxes. The bellman must return the used key to the same cashier after removing the luggage from the room.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>“Showroom” / Sales mock up rooms Keys
</strong></div><div>On a daily basis, a set of rooms will be blocked off for viewing purposes by the Duty Manager – Front Office.
</div><div>Two sets of keys to these rooms will be programmed and placed at the Front Office Reception for site visit purposes.
</div><div>Staff releasing the site visit keys must inform the receiver to return the keys back to the Reception upon completion.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>FIRE SAFETY
</strong></div><div>Fire is among the major potential hazards associated with hotels. It could take place due to cigarette smoking in rooms, faulty electrical wiring, or faulty equipment. Hotels must be equipped to safeguard guests and their property from fire by installing smoke detectors and by conducting routine checks to see that the wiring and equipment are not defective. All the employees must be aware of specific procedures laid down by the establishment and must be ready to comply with them at any time. There should be fire drills during low occupancy periods to check how the employees put their knowledge of laid down procedures into practice. Generally, fire extinguishers are installed in hotels at strategic locations and fire exits are earmarked for use in the event of fire. Guests should be made aware of the same.
</div><div>
</div><div>The presence of three basic components—fuel (a combustible substance), oxygen (necessary as fire is an oxidation reaction), and heat (ignition temperature)—results in the outbreak of fire. If any one of them is absent, fire cannot break out. Fire can be extinguished by starving, smothering, and cooling
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>• Starving</strong> Starving is the removal of fuel from the vicinity of fire so that it doesn't spread. In case fire breaks out in an area where wood is stored, it can be extinguished by removing all the wood (fuel) from that area. This way one of the major components of fire will be eliminated.
</div><div><strong>• Smothering</strong> Smothering is the removal of air. Fire can be extinguished by cutting off the supply of air (oxygen), which is necessary for the existence of fire. Throwing a blanket over fire smothers the air and extinguishes the fire.
</div><div><strong>• Cooling</strong> Heat (ignition temperature) is also essential for the existence of fire. Cooling by adding water—brings down the temperature and puts out fire.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Classification of Fire
</strong></div><div>Depending upon the combustible material that has caught fire, fire is classified in the following five groups:
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Types of Fires
</strong></div><div>Not all fires are the same. Per NFPA 10, burning may be classified into one or more of the following fire classes and your fire protection specialist will select the right fire extinguisher size and agent for the hazard.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• Class A
</strong></div><div>Class A fires are fires in ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, rubber, and many plastics.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• Class B
</strong></div><div>Class B fires are fires in flammable liquids such as gasoline, petroleum greases, tars, oils, oil-based paints, solvents, alcohols. Class B fires also include flammable gases such as propane and butane. Class B fires do not include fires involving cooking oils and grease.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• Class C
</strong></div><div>Class C fires are fires involving energized electrical equipment such as computers, servers, motors, transformers, and appliances. Remove the power and the Class C fire becomes one of the other classes of fire.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• Class D
</strong></div><div>Class D fires are fires in combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, sodium, lithium, and potassium.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>• Class K
</strong></div><div>Class K fires are fires in cooking oils and greases such as animal and vegetable fats.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Procedure in the Event of Fire
</strong></div><div>•  The guidelines for the front office staff in the event of fire are as follows:
</div><div>• When fire is detected, inform the concerned people immediately.   
</div><div>• Do not panic.
</div><div>• Warn other people in the vicinity and sound the fire alarm
</div><div>• Do not jeopardize your own safety or that of others.
</div><div>• Follow the procedure laid down by your establishment
</div><div>• Call the fire brigade immediately
</div><div>• Dot not try to extinguish fire if you are not trained for the same; fire may spread if not handled properly
</div><div>• If you are trained for firefighting, use the appropriate fire extinguisher to put out the fire.
</div><div>• Close the doors and windows; turn off the supply of electricity and gas
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>It is important that all the passageways are kept clear and the doors and windows are opened. Fire exits should be marked properly and should be visible in dark too. The fire extinguishers should be placed at proper places and should be in working condition. Fire drills should be carried out periodically. Fire detection systems, sprinkling systems, smoke detecting systems, fire fighting equipment, like fire hoses, etc. should be inspected and tested at regular intervals to ensure that they remain functional in the event of fire.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>ACCIDENTS
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>According to Advanced Learner's dictionary, an accident is 'an unpleasant event that happens unexpectedly and causes injury or damage'. Accidents may occur due to any one of the following reasons:
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Excessive</strong> <strong>Haste</strong> Excessive haste is among the prime causes of accidents because a person in haste may overlook the safety rules or obstacles in the way. Therefore, to avoid accidents, one must not be in a hurry or run while on the job. For example, bell boys, when in a hurry to carry the luggage of a group, may overlook objects in blind corners and may meet with an accident.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Carelessness</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Carelessness is also a common cause of accidents. The careless handling of goods and equipment may lead to accidents. For example, if a bell boy is careless with the luggage, he may trip and fall.</span><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Anxiety</strong> Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear about something. An anxious person will not be able to concentrate on the task at hand and this might lead to accidents.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Lack of Interest</strong> If a person lacks interest in what she is doing, she becomes careless and doesn't follow the correct procedure for carrying out a task, leading to accidents.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Lack of Concentration</strong> A person may not be able to concentrate on work due to personal problems, lack of interest, distractions, etc. The lack of concentration may lead to problems and accidents.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Failure to Apply Safety Rules</strong> Safety rules, if followed, prevent accidents. Before operating any equipment, one should read and follow the operating instructions given in the product manual in order to eliminate the chances of accidents. The failure to apply safety rules may cause accidents.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Accidents in Hotels
</strong></div><div>In hotels, accidents usually happen in one of the following areas:
</div><div>• Stairways
</div><div>• Balconies or landings
</div><div>• Ramps
</div><div>• Parking lots
</div><div>• Bathtubs or showers
</div><div>To minimize the number of accidents and to avoid workplace injuries, the hotels should take care of the common problems, some of which are as follows:
</div><div>• Presence of handrails/guardrails
</div><div>• Presence of a non-slip surface
</div><div>• Adequacy of landing areas
</div><div>• The accident victim's field of vision
</div><div>• The accident victim's health and behavior
</div><div>• Adequacy of lighting
</div><div>• Weather conditions (wet, snowy) and maintenance (cleaned, recently polished)
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Accident Report
</strong></div><div>In spite of all the precautions taken by hotels to prevent accidents, mishaps may still occur. If a staff member meets with an accident within the hotel premises, it must be reported to the management and a record of the accident must be entered in the accident book.
</div><div>
</div><div>A proper reporting of accidents is important for the following reasons:
</div><div>• The accident-prone areas may be identified so that appropriate signs may be placed there to avoid any future accidents.
</div><div>• First aid may be given to the injured person.
</div><div>• If the injury is serious, an ambulance may be summoned.
</div><div>• The damage/loss due to the accident can be assessed.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>FIRST AID
</strong></div><div>According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, first aid is 'the simple medical treatment that is given to somebody before a doctor comes or before the person can be taken to a hospital'. It is mandatory for an establishment to have adequate first aid equipment, facilities, and trained personnel to provide first aid in the work area. If the injury is serious, the injured person should be treated by a doctor or a qualified nurse as soon as possible.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>First Aid Box
</strong></div><div>There should be a first aid box in the work area and it should be easily identifiable and accessible. It should be in the charge of a responsible person, who should ensure that the consumed medicines are replenished and the expired medicines are replaced regularly. A first aid box must contain the following things:
</div><div><br></div><div>• A card giving general first-aid guidance.
</div><div>• Twenty individually wrapped, sterile, adhesive, waterproof dressings of various sizes.
</div><div>• An antiseptic lotion and an antiseptic cream.
</div><div>• Cotton wool packets (4 x 25 g).
</div><div>• One dozen safety pins.
</div><div>• Two triangular bandages.
</div><div>• Two sterile eye pads, with attachment.
</div><div>• Four medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.
</div><div>• Two large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings. 
</div><div>• Two extra large-sized sterile unmedicated dressings.
</div><div>• Scissors
</div><div>• A report book to record all injuries.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>First Aid for Some Common Problems
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Shock</strong> The signs of shock are faintness, sickness, clammy skin, and pale face. A person who has suffered a shock should be made to lie down. To make him comfortable and warm, he should be covered with a blanket or additional clothes.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Cuts</strong> All cuts should be washed with an antiseptic lotion and covered with a waterproof dressing. In case of considerable bleeding, it should be stopped as soon as possible by bandaging firmly or by pressing the artery with thumb. If bleeding doesn't stop, immediate medical assistance should be sought.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Nose Bleeding</strong> Tn case of nose bleeding, the person should be asked to sit down with the head bent forward- His clothing should be loosened round the neck, chest,  and waist. To stop the bleeding, apply pressure and pinch the nostrils closed for about  five minutes. Nose bleeding occurs due to the rupture of the fine capillary of artery; applying pressure and keeping the nostril closed provides sufficient time for blood coagulation. If bleeding persists, seek medical assistance.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Fainting</strong> A person may faint after standing for a long period in a hot, badly ventilated area. The symptoms include whiteness, giddiness, and sweating. The perv;n should be made to lie down and his legs should be raised slightly above the level of his head. when he regains consciousness, he should be kept in fresh air for a while and it should be ensured that he did not injure himself when he fainted.  
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Fractures</strong> In case of a suspected fracture, the first step should be to remove any pressure from the affected part and to make it immobile. One should not try to  realign the bone and seek immediate medical assistance. If there is bleeding, apply pressure to the wound with a sterile bandage or a clean cloth. To prevent swelling and to relieve pain till the medical assistance arrives, apply ice packs wrapped in a towel or a piece of cloth. If the person feels faint or is breathing in short, rapid breaths, he should be made to lie down,with the head slightly lower than the trunk, and, if possible, his legs should be elevated.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Burns</strong> and Scalds Burn is caused by a dry heat source like flame or hot articles, whereas scalds are caused bv a wet heat source like steam or boiling liquids. The  burnt part should be placed under running cold water or immersed in cold water till the pain ceases. If it's a major burn, seek the assistance of a doctor.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>• Muscle Strain</strong> In case of a sprain, stop the activity that caused the injury and appJy ice to the injured area to reduce swelling. Use a bandage to restrict the movement of the injured area, and, if possible, elevate the injured part to make the fluids drain away.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>HANDLING UNUSUAL EVENTS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Besides accidents and injuries, the hotel staff should be equipped to handle unusual events and emergency situations like:
</div><div>• Terrorist activities and bomb threat
</div><div>• Robbery and theft
</div><div>• Drunken guests
</div><div>
