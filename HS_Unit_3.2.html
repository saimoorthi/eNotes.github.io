            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><div>Pests have been a nuisance to mankind from time immemorial. With the advancement of science, there is now a better understanding of the various sanitary practices, chemical treatment and better facilities are available to enable effective pest control. A vigilant food service worker can play an important role in protecting food from contamination and wastage and in maintaining the reputation of the catering establishment.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>IMPORTANCE OF PEST CONTROL</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>1. Contamination</strong> Contamination of food leading to food poisoning and other serious diseases in humans, is a major hazard of a pest infestation. This is so because pests move from dirt to food and transfer harmful microorganisms to it.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>2. Legal Requirement</strong> According to the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (1954), if any food article consists either wholly or in part of any filthy, putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal or vegetable substance or is insect infested or is otherwise unfit for human consumption it is deemed to be adulterated. Serving adulterated food is punishable by law.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>3. Wastage and Destruction</strong> Ten per cent of the world's harvested cereals are destroyed by rodents and insects, which if saved could feed 260 million people. Rodents are known to destroy pipes, insulation and cables. Termites and textile pests cause grave damage to the woodwork and upholstery. Beetles, weevils and warehouse moths destroy commodities, making them unfit for consumption. Rodents contaminate much more food with their hair and droppings than they actually eat.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4. Reputation</strong> The reputation of any catering establishment depends largely on the prevailing hygienic conditions. Flies hovering over uncovered food and insect body parts and droppings found in food can be very repulsive to the consumer, thus damaging the establishment's reputation. Hence, proper sanitary practices and pest control measures would go a long way in building up goodwill among customers and in turn will improve financial gains.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF PESTS
</strong></div><div>Pests commonly found in a catering facility can be divided into the following categories:
</div><div>* Insects which include houseflies, fruit flies, cockroaches, silverfish, firebrats and stored grain insects.
</div><div>* Rodents which include rats and mice; and animals and birds which include cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Housefly
</strong></div><div>The housefly is one of the filthiest of pests and is found all over the world. It has a hairy body, three pairs of legs, each having a pad with glandular hairs. Secretions from these pads enable dirt and germs to stick to it, which is later transferred to food, equipment or any other surface it lands on.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Control Measures
</strong></div><div>1. Environmental sanitation can be achieved by proper disposal of garbage, decaying food and animal carcasses and other wastes.
</div><div>2. All food wastes should be held in tightly covered bins and preferably refrigerated to reduce decay and fly activity. Clean garbage containers thoroughly.
</div><div>3. Protective display of food using fly proof cupboards, wire gauze covers, etc., should be practised.
</div><div>4. Adequate fly proofing of doors and windows of kitchens and food service areas helps prevent their access to food. Self-closing doors and windows prevent their entry.
</div><div>5. Air currents or curtains protect the establishment from the entry of insects and dust. They are mounted outside and above the door.
</div><div>6. Various insecticidal sprays, aerosols and pellets are effective in controlling fly populations in kitchens and food service areas.
</div><div>7. Poisonous baits and fly strips are a combination of an insect-attracting food like sugar and an insecticide. Since they are poisonous, they should be used and stored with care. They are recommended for outdoor use.
</div><div>8. Swatting with fly swatters is not recommended in preparation, storage or service areas. Swatters are contaminated and spread dead insects and their body parts when they are used
</div><div>9. Insect Light Traps (ILTs) - All species of flies are naturally attracted to UV-A light. This property is made use of in attracting and trapping flies
</div><div>10. The flying insect catcher also attracts insects by emitting UV-A light but traps them onto two glue boards; one placed at the back of the trap and a second at the bottom of the trap.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Fruit Fly
</strong></div><div>These are seasonal, coloured and smaller than the housefly. They are most attracted to overripe and decaying fruit. These pests are not attracted to sewage and other wastes, hence transmit less number of microorganisms.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Their larvae eat their way through different fruits and spoil them</span></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Control Measures
</strong></div><div>1. Check fruit supplies for signs of infestation.
</div><div>2. Get rid of decaying fruit and other fermenting foodstuffs.
</div><div>3. Use screens, wire meshes and air currents to prevent their entry. 
</div><div>4. Electric fly traps, to a certain extent, are useful in exterminating them.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Cockroaches
</strong></div><div>The cockroach is another resilient pest known to man. It is filthy and gives off a foul odour. Cockroaches contaminate unprotected food, utensils and other surfaces. They travel from sewers to garbage dumps. En-route, they collect numerous disease-causing microorganisms on their bodies and in their stomachs. Uncontrolled cockroach infestations could spread diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid fever, intestinal worms and food poisoning.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Control Measures
</strong></div><div>1.	Persistent efforts at maintaining good sanitary conditions is the key to cockroach control. Covering dustbins at night, keeping food service areas free from dirt and food particles as well as prompt garbage disposal are essential.
</div><div>2.	All cracks and crevices should be properly sealed.
</div><div>3.	Good lighting and ventilation prove to be a deterrent to pests favouring dark, damp places to rest and breed.
</div><div>4.	Protect food from contamination by proper storage. Scrutinising bags and sacks for insect eggs and body parts, helps check the entry of these pests into the premises.
</div><div>5.	Permitted insecticides should be applied to cracks and crevices, undersides of tables, cupboards, equipment, behind sinks and other areas likely to harbour these pests.
</div><div>6.	Cockroach traps should be installed over drains.	over a drain
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Ants
</strong></div><div>These common but annoying pests are known to mechanically transmit diseases from excrement to food. Ants cause immense wastage of food by eating some of it, thus making the food unfit for human consumption. They are known to destroy crops and also eat into wrappers.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Control Measures
</strong></div><div>1.	Good sanitary practices should be followed.
</div><div>2.	Food should be kept covered.
</div><div>3.	Suitable pesticides should be applied.
</div><div>
</div><div>Stored Grain Insects
</div><div>Some of the insects in this group include: flour beetle, rice weevil, granary weevil, the Indian-meal moth, saw-toothed grain beetle, lesser grain borer and angoumois grain moth. 
</div><div>These insects are like beetles with a long snout. They attack and destroy stored grains. The female grain weevil punctures the grain with her snout and lays an egg in each hole. The grub or larva burrows into the grain and eats away a part of the grain. They cause heavy losses and damage to the quality of the grain.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Control Measures
</strong></div><div>1.	All food items should be properly inspected before entering the storage area, for weevils, larvae, webbing or agglutinated grains and damaged packaging.
</div><div>2.	Thorough cleaning and drying of all containers before storing fresh food articles is necessary.
</div><div>3.	Discard contaminated food.
</div><div>4.	The rule first-in-first-out should be followed for all commodities.
</div><div>5.	There should be good ventilation, ensuring that storage areas are kept dry and cool.
</div><div>6.	Insect-proofing of bags: a solution containing insecticides is sprayed on the outer surface of the gunny bags in which grains are stored. This remains effective for six to eight months.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Rodents
</strong></div><div>It is mainly the rats and mice belonging to this group that trouble human kind. Equipped with a pair of sharp, chisel-like teeth, they gnaw into plastic, cardboard and other thin food containers. Rats are voracious eaters and are known to destroy food grains and standing crops. They devour eggs, attack poultry and their burrowing habit causes structural damage to buildings.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong><em>Rodent infestation can be detected by:
</em></strong></div><div>1.	Odours which emanate from their urine.
</div><div>2.	Marks left behind from gnawing and their claws. Their presence can also be ascertained by their foot marks in spilt flour, dust, etc.
</div><div>3.	Sounds they make while eating and scurrying about. Their presence during the day is a sign of a heavy infestation, as they are otherwise sensitive to light and prefer to come out in the dark.
</div><div>4.	The 'runs' are runaway marks they make from their breeding places to the source of food and water. These pathways are dark and greasy due to the grease found on the rodent's body. Finding these trails helps in placing baits and traps near the breeding places.
</div><div>5.	Excrement in the form of droppings are a sure sign of their presence. In fact, the size of the droppings helps determine a rat or a mice infestation. 
</div><div>The rat stool is larger (20 mm or 3/4 inch) than the mouse stool (6 mm or 1/4 inch). Fresh shiny stools confirm their presence in the establishment.
</div><div>6.	Burrows which are seen in places surrounding the building, like fences, spaces in the foundation and pathways, also indicate their presence. t!
</div><div>7.	The presence of rodent carcasses is an indication of a prevailing rodent menace.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Control Measures 
</strong></div><div>Effective rodent-control is possible only if the food handler is made aware of all the steps involved and the sequence in which prevention and elimination should be carried out.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>1.	Deny entry:</strong> Rodents gain entry through open drains, doors, windows, ventilators, openings around water pipes, sewers, by burrowing around weak construction points and faults in the foundation.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>2.	Deny breeding space:</strong> Store rooms and kitchens provide perfect sanctuaries for rats and mice. Rodent's preferences for dark, dirty, undisturbed places would imply that ample lighting, good housekeeping and high standards of tidiness could get rid of their breeding areas.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>3.	Making the environment less attractive to rodents: </strong>This can be achieved by protecting the food supply using wire meshing and by keeping sacks of flour off the floor and away from the wall. Floors and work surfaces should be properly cleaned to remove dust, scraps of food, crumbs and wastewater, in order to cut off the food and water supply to rodents.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4.	Trapping:</strong> using traps is an effective method of eliminating a rat population. Using a number of traps, locating their 'runways' and placing two traps in opposing directions and at an angle of 900 to the wall to catch them moving to and from their nests, ensures the trapping of maximum number of pests.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>5.	Poisoning:</strong> after ascertaining the rodent’s food preferences by 'pre-baiting', prepared baits should be placed along walls in runaways. Depending on how severe the infestation is, a number of baits should be used at regular intervals. Covering these bait stations with metal or cardboard covers prevents them from getting accidentally mixed up with food and also gives a sense of security to the 'suspicious' rodents. Once the baits are in place, all other sources of food and water should be inaccessible to these pests. Using gloves while handling baits and thorough washing of hands after the operation should not be neglected.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Other Pests
</strong></div><div>Animals and birds, whether pets or stray, should not be allowed to enter an area where food is prepared, stored or served. Cats, dogs, crows, sparrows and pigeons may present problems for the catering establishment.
</div><div>Domestic animals are carriers of ticks and mites and enteric pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonellae. Like humans, Staphylococci are found on the skin and nose of dogs and cats. Their presence is indicated by their droppings and signs of rubbish strewn around garbage bins.
</div><div>Birds carry mites and many harmful microorganisms. They peck at food and damage packages. The presence of bird droppings and loose feathers in or near food is obnoxious.  They can be controlled by
</div><div><br></div><div>•	installing screens on windows, doors and ventilators
</div><div>•	discouraging the entry of animals in the premises
</div><div>•	discouraging the practice of feeding leftovers to animals in the premises   proper storage and disposal of garbage
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Green Pest Management (GPM)
</strong></div><div>GPM is a pest control strategy using organic or plant based materials or materials of natural origin. It is an extension of integrated pest management and is looked upon as an eco-friendly pest management system. sometimes non-organic substances are also used in GPM if they are non-toxic and do not have a polluting effect on the environment, for example, insect bait stations that have synthetic active ingredients may be termed green. This is because the process of applying the product is also important in GPM.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>GPM is a proactive mode of controlling pests unlike conventional pest control that focuses on use of pesticides. Exclusion of pests, environmental changes and physical trapping are some of the non-pesticide measures used. GPM is considered to be the most advanced form of IPM and includes continuous training of technicians on common pests, inspection or identification of pests, latest developments in pest control measures, understanding its habits and biology, diagnosing and correcting pest friendly conditions, effect use of new products and sealants, proper inspection of the building and rectifying inlets.
</div><div>GPM strategies work with a long-term vision and finding more permanent solutions to pest control while minimising the use of toxic pesticides and educating the public that green products are not necessarily very costly, but are beneficial in the long run.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>
