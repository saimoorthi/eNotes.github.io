</div><div><br></div><div>Food contamination refers to the presence of harmful chemicals and microorganisms that can cause illness or injury in food when such food is consumed. Food contamination is a serious health problem that needs to be tackled. The effect of chemical contaminants on human health may sometimes be seen only after years of prolonged exposure at low levels, for example, carcinogens in food may build up in the body causing cancers. Unlike most microbiological agents, chemical contaminants present in food are not destroyed by thermal processing’s. Contaminants in food can be broadly classified into the following categories:

</strong></div><div>Contaminants include microorganisms growing in food causing spoilage and infection, cysts of parasites like nematodes and other worms that can cause infestations, protozoal infestations like amoebiasis, etc. When untreated human excreta are used as a fertilizer for plants, these organisms contaminate food. Rodents urinate or leave their droppings behind which harbour several kinds of disease producing bacteria and are responsible for the spread of human diseases. Microorganisms such as bacteria yeasts and mold can enter food at any stage of processing from the farm to the table and contaminate it.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Natural Toxins
</strong></div><div>Certain plants and animals may contain natural substances that are poisonous and may produce gastro-intestinal disturbances. Some may even prove fatal.
</div><div>Naturally Occurring Toxicants in Plants
</div><div>•	Lathyrus Sativus or Kesaridal
</div><div>•	Soybeans
</div><div>•	Green Potatoes
</div><div>•	Argemone Seeds
</div><div>• Mycotoxins
</div><div>•	Egrot
</div><div>•	Cereals &amp; Groundnuts
</div><div>•	Poisonous Mushrooms
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sea Food Toxins
</strong></div><div>Mussels and Clams (Shellfish) Ocean mussels and clams may be poisonous during some periods of the year when they feed on small crustaceans who in turn have been feeding on dinoflagellates (single-celled organisms). These dinoflagellates are toxic algae that produce the heat stable toxin PSP (paralytic shellfish poison), which is extremely toxic to humans. Symptoms include itching, numbness of lips and tongue, muscular weakness and respiratory paralysis that can be fatal.
</div><div>There are many natural toxins in foods, but most of these toxins cause toxicity only when consumed in excess. Small amounts of most of these may not be toxic; hence, toxins represent only minor hazards as compared to bacterial hazards
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Toxic Metals &amp; Chemicals
</strong></div><div>Metals, when consumed in excess of the requirements, could cause toxicity. These contaminants may be present in the environment and may accumulate during the different stages of food preparation. By the time food is ready to be consumed, it can reach levels that are toxic to humans. Some of the toxic metals are listed below.
</div><div>• Selenium
</div><div>• Zinc
</div><div>• Lead
</div><div>• Cadmium
</div><div>• Cobalt
</div><div>• Copper
</div><div>• Tin
</div><div>• Brass
</div><div>• Fluoride
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Pesticide Residues
</strong></div><div>Pesticide spray residues may contaminate foods such as cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables. Pesticides may also get into foods through soil, water and air.
</div><div>The improper application of pesticides like Aluminium phosphide or zinc oxide results in health hazards as these pesticides leave behind residues in the form of other compounds of aluminium or zinc metals. Other important chemicals are
</div><div><br></div><div>1.	Arsenic
</div><div>2.	Barium
</div><div>3.	Mercury
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Presence of Extraneous Material
</strong></div><div>Contaminants present in food could be nail chippings, hair, stones, grit, dirt or other extraneous matter. Accidental contamination by metallic fragments and shards of glass may render food harmful. Some common metal fragments are stapler pins, flexible aluminium wire, metal curls and fine filings from canned food opened with a defective opener. Glass chips may enter food from broken glassware, or misuse of glass for taking out crushed ice.
</div><div>Physical contaminants may be organic or inorganic. Organic contaminants include plant parts, debri, weeds, seeds, poisonous seeds of Dhatura, dead insects, excreta, uric acid, rodent hair, etc., while inorganic contaminants include lumps of earth, stones, dust, glass, etc.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Processing &amp; Packaging Material
</strong></div><div>Most foodstuff available in the market today has been subjected to some form of processing and packaging. While processing and packaging may prolong the life of the product, the main purpose of packaging is to provide a physical barrier for contaminants. Processing and packaging contaminants are not present in raw food materials but are generated during the stages in processing like high temperature, fermentation, etc. Processing contaminants are formed by chemical reactions between natural and/or added food constituents during processing. Examples are nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and trans fat.
</div><div> 
</div><div>The level of these contaminants in processed foods can be minimised by regulating processes. Processing equipment’s may also contribute towards metal contamination through metal fragments from equipment’s like copper as well as lubricants, cleaning and sanitizing agents.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Although packaging materials help in keeping food free from contaminants, some are known to add contaminants to food.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA) used in plastic food containers and cans is known to leach from products and get absorbed in low concentrations by the human body and may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Phthalates are found in adhesives, cling films and some printing inks. They may be carcinogenic and are also linked to hormonal imbalances. Apples with little stickers stuck on them and any food wrapped in cling film could have been contaminated by phthalates. Small amounts of aluminium may pass onto food from cookware or packaging. Food contact materials should be checked for safety.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Prevent Contamination</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Cross-contamination is the main reason for many food-borne illness outbreaks. Even if meat has been cooked correctly, meals can still become contaminated with pathogens if cross-contamination isn’t avoided in the preparation process.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Put simply, if raw foods come into contact with ready-to-eat foods, cross-contamination can occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Wash your hands
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water (warm or cold) and dry them:
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div>• Before handling food
</div><div>• After handling raw food – including meat, fish, eggs and vegetables
</div><div>• After touching the bin, going to the toilet, blowing your nose or touching animals (including pets)
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Wash worktops, knives and utensils
</strong></div><div>Wash worktops, knives and utensils before and after preparing food, particularly after they've been touched by raw meat (including poultry), raw eggs, fish and vegetables.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Use separate chopping boards
</strong></div><div>•	Use a separate chopping board to prepare raw food, such as meat and fish. 
</div><div>•	This is to avoid contaminating ready-to-eat foods with harmful bacteria that can be present in raw food before it has been cooked.
</div><div>•	Before reusing them, thoroughly clean and sanitise plates, utensils and cutting boards that have come into contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs.
</div><div>•	Chopping boards should be replaced if they are excessively scratched or damaged. 
</div><div>•	Damaged chopping boards develop grooves that are hard to clean, making bacteria difficult to eliminate.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Keep raw meat separate
</strong></div><div>• It's especially important to keep raw meat away from ready-to-eat foods, such as salad, fruit and bread.
&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">• This is because these foods will not be cooked before you eat them, so any bacteria that get onto the foods from the raw meat will not be killed.&nbsp;</span></div><div>• 
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Store raw meat on the bottom shelf&nbsp;</span></div><div>• Always cover raw meat and store it on the bottom shelf of the fridge, where it cannot touch or drip onto other foods.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Store Food in the Right Place
</strong></div><div>Where you store food plays a major role in preventing cross-contamination. When placing foods in the refrigerator, where and how foods are stored is incredibly important.
</div><div>
</div><div>•	Raw meats should always be stored on the bottom shelf. This eliminates the risk of juices dripping onto other foods and contaminating them.
</div><div>•	Raw meat, poultry and seafood should be stored in covered containers or sealed plastic bags to prevent their juices from dripping or leaking onto other foods.
</div><div>•	If you’re not planning on using meat within a few days of purchase, it should be placed in the freezer for defrosting at a later date.
</div><div>•	Meats and ready-to-eat foods should never be placed next to each other or on the same shelves.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Food Safety Training
</strong></div><div>The best way to prevent cross-contamination, and the serious consequences it can cause, is to train your employees. Everyone who handles food in your business should have at least a basic knowledge of food-borne illness and food allergens, including:
</div><div>
</div><div>•	food-borne bacteria and what they need to thrive
</div><div>•	how food can become contaminated
</div><div>•	signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction
</div><div>•	the importance of good personal hygiene
</div><div>•	the importance of following food safety protocols and best practices
</div><div>•	the risks and consequences of cutting corners when it comes to food safety
